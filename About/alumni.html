For his thesis he researched the idea that work and labour are foundational human activities, and this has deeply influenced his current work in urban planning and transportation. He is presently researching the effect commuting has on health, and hopes to further focus his studies on the relationship between transportation and urban economics. In addition to his academic experience, Alex has worked as a cook and a barn-raiser, helped start and manage a new food-truck, and has written short stories and some poems.

						Lisa was born and raised in the rural community of Hemmingford, but her interests in the inner workings of cities drew her to Montreal to commence a bachelor's degree in Urban Studies at Concordia University. Lisa is currently pursuing a Master of Urban Planning at McGill University. Seeing transportation issues as a major threat to the quality of life in downtown centres, Lisa is especially interested in the interrelation of land uses and transportation infrastructure, as well as traffic calming and Transit-Oriented Development. Lisa worked with TRAM as a graduate research assistant in summer 2008. She was involved in developing the TRAM data archive as well as a couple of other projects. She is currently working as a Manager of Capital and Urban Planning at Cree Regional Authority.
