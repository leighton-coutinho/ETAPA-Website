						Mariam Hosni is a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering at McGill University. She is currently conducting a meta-analysis and systematic review for life cycle assessments of electricity generation in Canada. She is also performing a life cycle assessment on battery energy storage technologies utilization for grid applications. In addition, she is working on completing a life cycle assessment of electricity generation from wind turbines across Canada by utilizing an inventory she is compiling herself. Mariam is experienced in big data processing where she previously analyzed millions of observations for monthly household electricity consumption and daily waste generation per bin. In addition, she specializes in life cycle assessments of various environmental systems, such as sustainable water supply systems and waste management strategies. She has also completed an experimental analysis on enhancing methane production form anaerobic digesters by the addition of syngas.
