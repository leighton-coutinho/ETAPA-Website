						Meredith finished her masters in Civil Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal, where she developed a keen interest in the link between travel behaviour, travel satisfaction and the built environment. In her masters thesis, she studied the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the relationship between Montrealers’ travel satisfaction and their immediate neighbourhood using GIS and survey data, and hypothesized how the the pandemic could impact planning and travel in the long term. Her main research interests are active transportation, more specifically walking, and how urban planning can contribute to healthy and environmentally-friendly travel behaviour.

						Hisham is a PhD student, with a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Architectural Engineering and Urban Design from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt. During his course of study, he developed an interest in physical urban design and how people use public urban spaces. This led his master’s research to focus on pedestrian stationary and movement behavior in urban spaces, connecting spatial theories with built environment realities and social interactions. Hisham’s current research interest revolves around accessibility by public transport and its relation to improving quality of life of individuals. He has special interest in understanding the travel needs of marginalized groups and its relation to accessibility to generate practice-ready policy recommendations.

						Having developed an interest for transportation research in his last year of undergraduate studies, Lancelot has been working with TRAM since May 2021. He has graduated with a BASC in Sustainability, Science and Society and a MSc in Geography both at McGill University and is now pursuing a PhD in Planning, Policy and Design in the School of Urban Planning. While he collected and studied detailed micro-scale walkability data for his Master's thesis, Lancelot is now exploring post-pandemic pricing and funding issues for public-transit and related equity considerations for his doctoral research. Lancelot is also passionate about the intersection between transportation and planning regulation as well as public perceptions of transportation services and projects.

						Rodrigo is a PhD student who graduated from his B.Sc. and MSc. in Civil Engineering at the University of Concepción, Chile, where he developed a deep interest in urban mobility and transport planning. In both his undergraduate and master’s theses he studied the interrelationships of different dimensions that shape people’s travel behavior, including time use, social interaction, and modal choice. Having been born and lived most of his life in Chile, he has a deep concern about problems that are especially relevant in the Global South, and which may be addressed through efficient transport planning, such as income and social inequality. In his last years before coming to Montreal, he collaborated in different research centers where he studied topics related to covid-19 spread and mobility patterns in the Chilean context. Today, he’s excited to start learning and collaborating in TRAM’s research.

Heba holds a B.Sc. in Architectural Engineering from Palestine and an M.Sc. in Urban and Regional Planning from Ball State University in the United States. Her passion for community development is evident through her extensive work with UN-Habitat, various international NGOs, and civil society organizations in Palestine. Currently, Heba is pursuing a second M.Sc. in Planning, Policy, and Design at McGill University's School of Urban Planning. Her professional journey has revealed a critical need to delve deeper into transport dynamics, planning, and operations. This interest has fueled her focus on transportation issues at the community level. As a member of the TRAM team, Heba is dedicated to exploring the transportation needs of immigrants to Canada and addressing the challenges of mobility inequality faced by recent arrivals.
