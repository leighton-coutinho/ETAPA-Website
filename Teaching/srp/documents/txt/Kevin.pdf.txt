ABSTRACT  
In the past several decades increases in personal mobility brought on by technological advances and  other land use and transportation factors has led to lengthening the daily commutes for many North  Americans.  Most of the increase in daily mobility is by privately owned vehicles. This increase in vehicle  miles travelled (VMT) has lead to drastic increases in pollution and congestion. In an era of rising fuel  costs, an unsure energy future, and climate change, understanding the factors leading to longer car trips  is indispensable for planners and policy makers aiming towards lowering total vehicle miles travelled.  The goal of this research is to better understand hometowork travel behaviour throughout the  Montral Metropolitan region. This is undertaken in several steps. First, a factor and cluster analysis of  demographic, urban form, land use and accessibility measures is performed over the entire region based  on a finescale grid pattern. This information on neighbourhood characteristics is then combined with  detailed personal and household data available from the 2003 Montral OriginDestination Survey on  over 40,000 hometowork trips. In addition, a linear regression is developed to explain trip length as a  function of personal, household and land use characteristics at the point of origin and destination for  automobile trips. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is used to understand the effects of neighbourhood types  on trip length while controlling for the geographic location. It is shown that suburbtosuburb  commuting is both more prevalent and not as long as expected. Commuters who cross bridges to  downtown are travelling much further than those who live and work in the same subregion. The  approach developed here is shown to be useful in understanding regional travel behaviour and points  towards further study and discussion in this vital area of transportation research.

INTRODUCTION 
The influence of transportation technology, infrastructure, policy, government funding, and increasing  personal wealth over the past century has had a profound influence on daily travel patterns. Daily  commuting distances for many North Americans today are much larger than commuting distances from  a decade or two ago. While, much of this mobility has an undoubtedly positive influence on quality of  life in the form of access to emergency transportation, cultural opportunities, tourism and the ability to  match residential preferences with job location preferences, there exists a vast array of negative  externalities in the form of pollution, sprawl, congestion and social equity.   
Crane and Schweitzer (2001) summarize the resource problems associated with widespread of  automobile use. Apart from the obvious adverse effects of fuel combustion, they also include other  factors such as noise, health issues related to physical inactivity, difficulty in recycling car parts, waste  oil, social and economic disruption, visual blight, safety issues, and the feedback loop between auto use,  road construction and sprawl. Many of these problems could be addressed through lowering VMT on  North American roads. They also note that while technological advances in the form of "cleaner" cars  may reduce emissions from fossil fuel combustion, they will little to stem the proliferation of low density, autodependent places, improve road safety, get people walking for exercise, or slow the  demand for new road construction.  
Put another way, the simple substitution of conventional combustion engines with hybrid or biofuel  vehicles without changing current North American driving habits is clearly not a longterm solution.  While the adoption of alternative fuels and more efficient engines is clearly welcome, particularly for  transport and transit purposes, it will never solve the wider issues of congestion, wasted time and  capital. It is with this in mind that it is suggested that the distance traveled is the most pressing issue.  Reducing Vehicle Miles Travel (VMT) could be considered the most efficient way of reducing pollution  and congestion.   
Studies have shown that personal automobiles are producing a growing proportion of pollution and  green house gas emissions. For example, Marquez and Smith (1999) showed that 18% of British  Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions are from personal car usage. According to the U.S. National  Household Travel Survey (Hu and Reuscher 2004) hometowork travel contributes to 27% of total VMT  in American cities. For that reason, reducing VMT related to hometowork travel can be a key element  leading towards sustainable travel patterns.  
Although daily hometowork trips  make up only a portion of the total vehicle miles travelled, there are  several sound reasons why this is the basis of this research. First, shopping and social trips are much less  likely to be regular and consistent. Also, as Shearmur (2006) points out, the hometowork commute  often serves to structure other trips made during the day. In other words, where one shops is more  likely to be influenced by one's work location than the opposite. In addition, hometowork trips are  likely to be repeated every day, therefore a thorough understanding of work trips is absolutely vital in  attempting to characterize regional travel behaviour.   5

In the past several decades, there has been a proliferation of research concerning the relationship  between built form and travel behaviour. The importance of this research is obvious, with vital  implications for planners, policy makers and environmentalists.  
Much of the current debate in the everelusive realm of landusetravel behaviour connection is  couched in claims made by new urbanists, and smart growth and other "antisprawl" advocates about  the connection between built form factors and travel behaviour. Much of the design underpinnings of  many new urbanist communities, in fact, are based on the assumption that design and travel behaviour  are intrinsically linked. While the idea is attractive, after all, why wouldn't more pedestrian friendly  design and locating origins and destinations closer together cause more people to make shorter, non motorized trips?    While it may seem selfevident that more dense neighbourhoods with social and  economic activities located in close proximity to one another will lead to less resource depleting car  trips, many other factors are at play when individuals and households make location and travel  decisions. As will be demonstrated below, one of the liveliest debates in modern transportation  planning deals with just this issue. At the heart of most discussions in planning circles regarding these  issues is the idea of how urban form, demographic factors and location affect travel behaviour.  
In short, changing travel behaviour through urban design remains a vision rather than a reality for  planners, designers and policy makers. It appears that changing people's attitudes is the major obstacle  in making longlasting behavioural changes in much of the population. Reaching this point is not possible  without a clear understanding of the factors affecting VMT and mode choices. 
Montral is currently adopting a comprehensive transportation plan that aims at reducing the  dependence on single occupancy vehicles and encourages alternative modes (Ville de Montral 2008).  Knowing the factors affecting trip distances will help in recommending a set of policies that would have  the highest impact on Montral residents. The lessons learned from this study can be beneficial to other  regions in North America and around the world that are facing similar challenges and trying to promote  shorter distances as a way towards more sustainable land use policies and transportation systems. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
This brief literature review will attempt to introduce some of the key concepts, debates and findings in  the discussion of the complex relationship between urban form, personal preferences, demographics,  residential choice and travel behaviour. 
The amount of published material on the links between landuse, accessibility, and socioeconomic  variables over the past three decades is staggering. Ewing and Cervero (2001) and Badoe and Miller  (2000) are both excellent introductions to many of these  issues. They present methodology and findings  of over 50 published papers on these issues and are valuable resources for previous studies. While the  degree to which travel and built form variables are connected is hotly debated, most studies have found  there is a correlation between certain key variables and travel behaviour.

EVOLUTION OF URBAN FORM AND THE RISE OF THE AUTOMOBILE 
It is beyond the scope of this paper to examine the evolution of the automobilecentric nature of most  North American cities. For detailed discussion about the evolution of North American road design and  the demise of the onceflourishing public transit system, recommended texts include, among others,  Dupuy (1999) and St. Clair (1981). St.Clair, in particular, offers an interesting treatise on the controversy  surrounding the failure of many streetcar systems in American cities in the early 20th Century and the  subsequent rise of the automobile over the decades.   
In brief, for centuries, technological advances have gradually allowed for the increasing distance  between workplace and home. As horse drawn carriages and later streetcars became the dominant  form of transport, the distance between home and work started to increase dramatically. As public  transit evolved and grew in North American cities in the late 1800's and early 20th Century, these home towork distances continued to expand.  
The widespread use of automobiles in the second half of the 20th Century has led to unprecedented  levels of personal mobility. With the growth of auto use, the very form of the city was changed to  accommodate cars. Safdie and Kohn  (1997) describe the "misfit" between the scale of North American  cities and their transportation systems. While streetcar suburbs grew up along transit routes and  remained relatively compact, the car, along with decreasing fuel costs, more efficient engines, not to  mention government subsidized highway construction converged to create a situation where personal  car ownership became not just practical, but  essential for many urban dwellers. At the beginning of the  21st Century, we live in a cardominated world where the vast majority of trips in North America are  taken in what is arguably the least energy efficient and most polluting option available.  
NEW URBANISM AND "SMART GROWTH" 
Many popular design philosophies have arisen in the last few decades with an expressed purpose to  question and improve upon the conventional suburban built form of much of North America, chief  among them new urbanism, neotraditional town planning, transitoriented development and Smart  Growth. It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully address all of the complex issues of these  movements. See especially Katz (1994) and Duany, PlaterZyberk et al (2000) for a detailed description  of the goals and aims of new urbanism. At the crux of these design philosophies is the assumption that  design can influence travel behaviour. While new urbanism also addresses issues of social interaction,  community, and architectural design, the concern in this paper is solely on the issue of travel behaviour.  While new urbanist communities have grown in popularity over the past two decades and studies have  shown some success in the reduction of auto trips, there remains much controversy regarding the  extent to which the particular design features of new urbanism are working towards reducing car usage. 
Another important aspect of new urbanism is the spatial distribution of these developments. A  neighbourhood that encourages walking and cycling might be successful for internal social and leisure  trips, nevertheless, the availability of employment, entertainment and other commercial activities

nearby will influence the number and length of car trips much more than anything related to  neighbourhood scale design. Many of these factors are market driven. Accordingly, it might take several  years for commercial activities to sprout up around a new residential development. Conversely, it could  be argued that travel behaviour in infill developments is less dependent on internal factors than the fact  that, by definition, shops and employment opportunities are most likely nearby. Many new urbanist  neighbourhoods are designed to facilitate internal walking and cycling trips but located such that exiting  neighbourhood generally requires a car.  
PREVIOUS STUDIES 
In an important contribution to this research, Cervero and Kockelman (1997) outline many of the  research methodologies and describe the "3Ds" of:  density, diversity, and design. It is through these key  elements, it is thought, that policy can influence travel behaviour. 
The most elusive aspect of this debate concerns causality. In other words, it is straightforward enough  to show that residents of farflung singleuse residential areas with limited local services travel further  than residents of dense, mixeduse centrallylocated areas. However, a very basic examination might  reveal that the former is full of wealthy, carowners with a stated preference for driving and living on  large lots, while the later neighbourhood is a lowincome area with little car ownership or residents with  a stated preference for walking. In other words, without controlling for these demographic variables,  the findings could very well be meaningless. Most importantly, it would clearly be misleading at best to  claim that neighbourhood characteristics caused the resultant travel behaviour.  
If researchers are not careful to control for these issues, there might be strong autocorrelation. For  example, researchers have cautioned on the oversimplification in correlating density with both mode  choice and distance. Often, dense areas have a much lower median income (Crane 1996; Boarnet and  Crane 2001). As well, dense urban areas are often well served by transit, have limited parking and have  employment and commercial opportunities located in close proximity. Therefore simply increasing  suburban residential density would have little to no effect if an effort is not made to increase transit  infrastructure, mix commercial and residential land uses and limit parking. Other researchers have  remarked that the share of rental dwellings and residential density both act as proxies for income. They  suggest that, as many older parts of cities offer a predominantly rental market, the easy assertion that  older development, pre1945, offers better walkability is not so clear. Perhaps it is simply that more  people who cannot afford a car live there (van de Coevering and Schwanen 2006). 
This is the difficulty, turning this correlation into a causal relationship. The primary concern is one of  selfselection whereby households who enjoy walking or cycling choose to live in areas where this is  possible. This is arguably the core of the issue. In other words, do neighbourhood characteristics  influence behaviour or does behaviour influence choice of neighbourhood? 
 In order to prove a causal relationship between two variables, four criteria must be met: statistical  association, cause precedes effect, nonspuriousness, and a known mechanism (Handy, Cao et al. 2005).  This statistical association has proven to be difficult to obtain. However, research that employs surveys

of preference, and questions about past residential choices, as well as longitudinal studies can  approximate this type of inquiry. In short, indepth understandings of these issues can only come from  an indepth analysis of urban form and demographic facts, as well as a thorough understanding of a  household's preferences, tastes, past behaviour and future plans. 
Handy (2005), in a quasilongitudinal study, did find evidence for a causal relationship between changes  in travel behaviour and the built environment. However, a previous study by Handy and Clifton (2001)  found that selfselection largely explained the observed differences in travel behaviour. Some studies  have looked at personality types and travel behaviour noting that extroverts make more nonwork trips  than introverts and that certain character traits of urbanites might vary from suburbanites leading to  those residential choice decisions (Prevedouros 1992).  
Some studies (Kitamura, Mokhtarian et al. 1997; Limtanakool, Dijst et al. 2006) develop an extensive  questionnaire to capture household preferences. These types of studies can reveal much about attitudes  and go a long way towards understanding the relationship between urban form and travel. Kitamura et  al. (1997 p. 156), in fact conclude that "Attitudes are certainly more strongly, and perhaps more directly  associated with travel than are land use characteristics" They propose that land use policies alone will  have minimal affect on travel behaviour without a corresponding change in residents' attitudes. 
The issue is more about making these neighbourhood types more desirable for more people who could  otherwise "afford" to own a car and live in the suburbs.  As Badoe and Miller (2000) point out, this last  point brings up another question, namely, are these types of dense mixeduse neighbourhoods under represented in the marketplace? 
Another key issue concerns "trip replacement". Studies often point to the fact that residents might walk  more in certain neighbourhoods. While this is clearly a positive step for health and social reasons, if the  same person still commutes twentyfive kilometres a day at peak hours, it is arguable whether there is  much improvement in overall congestion and pollution. Interestingly, Crane (2000) presents a chart  showing how design elements such as gridbased street patterns, mixed land uses, traffic calming  devices, as well as combinations of all three have been seen to both increase car trips, VMT and car  modal split, this is a clear indication that these issues are still very much open for discussion. Cameron,  Kenworthy   et al. (2003) however found that urban form factors on their own explain 85% to 92% of the  variance in private automobile use and that therefore; urban form can lead to a close approximation of  a given region's emissions.  
The findings concerning monocentric versus polycentric urban form are often contradictory, on the one  the hand, while a polycentric form might allow residences and places of work to be closer together, the  ownership and use of automobiles has also grown as North American cities that have this type of spatial  pattern. This is the conclusion of Schwanen et al (2001) in a study of Dutch cities. They found that the  "deconcentration" urban land use "almost certainly promotes," car usage, particularly in cross commuting, that is, commuting from one suburb to another. Research of Coevering and Schwanen

(2006) also found that a higher percentage of jobs in the CBD was correlated with shorter daily  commutes.  
DEMOGRAPHICS 
The other primary factor in travel behaviour is demographics. While not all research is conclusive, and  much disagreement exists on the magnitude and importance of certain factors, there have arisen  several accepted general thoughts on how income and household characteristics impact travel  behaviour. 
Correlations between car ownership and income have been widely documented. Cameron et al. (2004)  however, present a case that policy makers and planners have tools at their disposal to control this  "inevitable" feedback loop. The last several decades have been both an era of unprecedented urban  growth with an accompanying increase in personal and household wealth.  He cites several Asian cities  that have successfully avoided becoming cardependent despite increasing wealth and car ownership. 
One line of reasoning concerning the increased use of the private automobile as income increases is  related to the value of time; the argument goes that as income rises so does the value placed on time.  The fact  or at least the perception  that cars are a much faster means of transportation would of  course lead to more ownership and use. In fact, Lave (1985) lays the burden of declining transit use  squarely on the shoulders of increased economic strength.  
However, others have speculated a differing view on the value of time. If time spent in a daily commute  is conceptualized as a cost, higher paid workers would be more willing and able to "pay" the cost of  longer commutes. In fact, from an economist's viewpoint travel decisions are thought of as simply a  trade off between salary, travel costs and housing costs (Shearmur 2006). While this is somewhat simple  to understand in a monocentric city, the polycentric nature of most North American cities makes this  much more complex to model. However, it is becoming more common to model these relationships  interactions (Schwanen, Dieleman et al. 2001; Dieleman, Dijst et al. 2002). 
Downs (1994) breaks the issue down to the inherent contradiction between the residential,  transportation and workplace desires of North Americans. He writes that the most common "vision" for  most North American households is based on four pillars. One: owning a detached, single family home  on a large lot.  Two: a privatelyowned vehicle and uncongested roads. Three, low rise, "parklike"  suburban workplaces, and four, strong local governments that will strictly control land use and allow for  citizen interaction with policy. This last point, in Downs' theory, serves to keep the character of the  suburban landscape by limiting unwanted land uses, in particular social housing and more dense  development.  The contradiction as Downs states it is obvious, if most North Americans live on large lots  and drive singleoccupancy vehicles at peak hours every day, uncongested roads are impossible to  maintain. While few would seriously question whether larger lots and spatially segregated land uses  causes longer commutes, achieving consensus on the policy implications this has proven to be quite  difficult.

Builing and Kanaroglou (2006) conclude that many land use policy attempts to facilitate more transit use  and shorter trips are often thwarted by the "tastes and preferences of households". They also found, in  agreement with Giuliano and Small (1993), that rising mobility in the last several decades "reduces the  significance of the regional distribution of employment as a determinant of travel behaviour". They also  question the degree to which minimizing commuting time plays in residential choice decisions. In short,  this line of research has shown that demographic factors are more likely to influence travel decisions  and behaviour than landuse policy changes. In other words, even though better transportation  technology and more lanes of traffic would arguably allow people to reduce their time cost in daily  commuting, many seem to prefer to simply live further from work instead of taking advantage of this  "time saving" option.   
Gender has also been shown to be a major determinant in travel behaviour, with males, travelling  farther in daily commutes. Income and education have been shown to be significant factors in  contributing to longer commutes. It has been hypothesized that lower income jobs have a better spatial  distribution than many high income jobs that will be located in concentrated in particularly areas. For  example, hospitals, universities, office towers, suburban office parks in contrast to retail and service,  convenience stores and so on that will be somewhat evenly dispersed throughout an urban region. In  other words, one might always be near a lowincome job, but kilometres away from a highpaying skilled  employment. Guiliano and Small (1993) present evidence from Los Angeles that suggests that  administrative and technical workers commute up to 40% longer than service workers. Other research  suggests that certain sectors of employment, trade and transport for example, tend to be located in low density areas along highways thereby making the modal split by car much higher for workers employed  in these fields (van de Coevering and Schwanen 2006). 
URBAN FORM CLASSIFICATION AND ANALYSIS 
The importance of understanding various urban forms has long been understood as central to informing  policy in land use and transportation. In recent years it has become even more vital to accurately and  objectively describe land use and urban form as words like "sprawl", "suburban" and even "mixed use"  become loaded with meaning and, at times, misuse. Recent research has highlighted the importance of  distinguishing between various types of sprawl (Talen 2002). Others have criticized the over simplification of defining suburbs simply as their distance from a downtown core (Song and Knaap  2004). Terms like mixeduse can have several meanings. Several studies have looked at he differences  between various employment centers in the Montral region (Coffey and Shearmur 2001; Shearmur and  Coffey 2002). Previous Factor and Cluster analysis in other North American cities  (Cervero and  Kockelman 1997; Song and Knaap 2004; Wilson, Krizek et al. 2004) have identified several recurring  types of development. Several additional studies have focused on identifying employment subcenters  (Anas, Arnott et al. 1998; McMillen 2004). 
Talen (2002) in an excellent introduction to many of the inherent issues at play when discussing,  defining and analyzing urban form, writes of the dangers of selecting variables that are "rarely  neutral[...] and can be loaded with subjective meaning".  She highlights the pitfalls of attempting to  measure and define "sprawl" and emphasizes the need to separate what could be called "good" or  11

"bad" sprawl. In other words, she asks, "is all development at the outer edges of an urban region  sprawl?"

It might be helpful to visualize how previous researchers have presented the complex interactions of  demographic, land use and policy interactions on travel behaviour. The first, Figure 1, is a  purposely   simplified version while Figure 2  attempts a more thorough accounting of the factors.

behaviour of a given individual or household. Bear in mind that this is itself somewhat simplified, several  factors would be included in the demographics category, for example family size, income; a household's  residential choice might change over time as incomes and household size increases. Also, as Badoe and  Miller (2000) point out, the complex "feedback" interactions are difficult to show in this diagram. For  example, travel behaviour decisions affect overall road congestion which might alter another user's  behaviour and choices. From a supply and demand viewpoint, neighbourhood travel decisions might,  over time, affect the level and frequency of transit service  in either direction. These complex  interactions are vital in understanding these issues.   
STUDY CONTEXT 
Montral is among the largest cities in North America. While Montral has a lively and economically  active urban core, recent years have seen suburban sprawl extend further into the surrounding regions.  Montral's location on an island in the St. Lawrence River connected to the mainland by 14 bridges and  a tunnel makes issues of traffic congestion from outlying suburbs even more pressing. Considering that a  large amount of daily traffic is concentrated in these corridors, understanding trips that cross one of the  bridges has important implications for planners.    
Montral has an extensive public transit system comprising bus, metro and commuter rail lines  extending far into the region (see Figure 3). Public transit also sees a large percentage of trips in the  region. While Montral has a strong downtown employment center, prior research has identified six  employment subcenters. Four are located on the island of Montral: the CBD, Anjou, Chabanal and  Dorval, in addition, "downtown" Longueuil, and Laval on the South and North Shore respectively. While  Montral is clearly not a monocentric city, it should be noted that the largest concentration of jobs is  on the island and in the CBD in particular. It is estimated that 182,000 jobs are located in the CBD alone  (Coffey and Shearmur 2001). In addition, although the city still has a vibrant core, the growth at the  centre has slowed recently in relation to outlying areas (Collin, Dagenais et al. 2003). 
The region of Montral extends north towards the Laurentians as well as west and South towards the  Ontario and U.S. border. The Montral Metropolitan region contains dozens of municipalities, many of  which were historically rural, farming villages. While it could be argued that the city has sprawled over  the last several decades, most development has remained along linear paths defined by major  expressways, most notably the 15, 30 and 20.  
The Island of Montral includes the City of Montral, made up of 19 boroughs, as well as 15 other  "reconstituted" cities that "demerged" in 2006 after the 2001 merger. The region includes 82  municipalities, each run by their own local government.  
According to statistics from the Communaut mtropolitaine de Montral, the region covers an area of  4,360 square kilometres and had a population of 3.6 million in 2007 with 1.4 million private dwellings,  1.84 million automobiles and 1.86 million jobs (Communaut Metropolitan de Montral 2009).

METHODOLOGY 
The travel behaviour literature suggests three main factors affecting trip length and mode choice. These  factors are 1) spatial configuration of land use and transportation at origin and destination; 2)  socioeconomic characteristics of traveler; and 3) travel costs associated with different modes (Cervero  and Kockelman 1997; Limtanakool, Dijst et al. 2006). Since the goal of this research is to better  understand the link between trip length and personal, household, neighbourhood, and destination area  characteristics, variables at each level are needed. 
For the neighbourhood level I identified thirtysix different variables that can have an effect on trip  length. These variables include land use, urban from, demographics, accessibility to transit and degree  and type of commercial activity. Then a data reduction technique was used to consolidate these local  neighbourhood characteristics into a small set of variables. To do so, the Metropolitan region was  divided into 150m x 150m grid cells. The selection of the grid cell size was based on reviewing previous  research modeling land use changes over time. For example UrbanSim uses a 150 metre grid cell  (Waddell 2004).  Factor and cluster analysis techniques were utilized to classify each grid cell to be part  of a certain neighbourhood type. This classification took into account the neighbourhood characteristics  in the cell as well as the cells adjacent to it. This means that there are two scales to the design, a central  cell of 150m x 150m and a combined cell of 450m x 450m.  
Travel distance from home to work was obtained from the 2003 Montral regional OriginDestination  survey (OD survey) using GIS software. The OD survey is a metropolitan survey that is conducted every  five years in the Montral region (AMT 2003). The OD survey includes disaggregate data on all trips that  were made by each person in a participating household. The survey includes 5% of all households in the  Montral Region. Data from the OD survey will be also used for the personal and household  characteristics. Trip characteristics, length, mode, purpose and time of departure will also be obtained  from the same dataset. Variables at the individual level include gender, age income, and total number of  trips. At the household level variables include number of people per house, number of vehicles, and  total number of trips.  
While many studies have made use of factor and cluster analysis to identify neighbourhood types or  regional subcenters, it is less common to use separate factor and cluster analyses of both home and  work locations.  
This paper will make use of several multivariate techniques in first reducing a substantial amount of data  on several thousand individual grid cells with over one hundred variables using factor analysis. Then, the  technique of Cluster analysis will further reduce the data by sorting the cells into much smaller groups.  Later binominal logistic models and multivariate regression techniques will be used to test the  dependence among variables by attempting to predict the likelihood of using a car for work commutes  (logit) and the trip length for automobile and transit trips (linear regression).

  DATA 
An initial list of thirtysix variables was compiled based on a thorough review of previous studies. This  literature review informed the choices of what variables would be measured and at what level. It should  be noted that some variables that are common in some studies in the U.S. were omitted in this study.  These mainly concern race and school performance. It is also important to note that the choice of  variables included examining variables that have been shown in the literature to correlate with either  travel behaviour or residential location decisions. Song and Knapp's, Internally Connected, No  Commercial, with a Touch of Open Space: The Neighbourhoods of New Homes in the Portland  Metropolitan Area (2004) was a key source for variable choice. Other important sources were Wilson et  al (2004), Krizek (2003), Cervero (2002), Limtanakool, Dijist et al. (2006) and Coffey and Shearmur  (2001). 
A comprehensive list covering land use, demographics, and accessibility and proximity issues was  generated; all of these were measured at the grid cell level. Later, the surrounding grid cells were  included in the analysis. As will be shown below, it is important to note that the Factor analysis removed  those variables that were not shown to significantly explain the observed differences in cells. 
The goal at this stage was to compile a set of data that would explain the differences between  neighbourhood types. Efforts were made to collect a wide range of variables. Not limiting the research  to solely landuse or accessibility or demographics helped to make the study a powerful tool in  describing regional variation in neighbourhood types.  
LAND USE AND ENVIRONMENT 
The area in each cell with the following land uses was measured: open space, park, commercial,  residential, industrial, institutional and water. This layer provides a good base layer for the more specific  data to follow. The above land use categories are quite general and the expected influence on travel  would be quite obvious. A mix of residential and commercial/employment uses would be expected to  correlate with a reduction of both car usage and trip length. The inclusion of the land uses of water and  parks is simply to achieve a deeper understanding of the neighbourhood types. 
FAMILY STRUCTURE/ DEMOGRAPHICS 
Information on income and family structure was collected using Canadian Census data from 2001, the  closest census to the 2003 OriginDestination survey. This category included the variables: average  household size, average number of children, median household income, average number of bedrooms,  and average number of rooms. 
An increase in any of these variables is thought to increase both the likelihood of car use and household  VMT (Frank and Pivo 1994; Crane 1996; Cervero and Kockelman 1997; Badoe and Miller 2000; Crane  2000; Ewing and Cervero 2001; Cervero 2002; Handy, Cao et al. 2005).

An explanation given by van de Couvering and Schwanen (2006) is that for larger households the car  offers much better "spacetime flexibility" and perceived safety, particular in relation to biking, for  families with small children (van de Coevering and Schwanen 2006). 
ACCESSIBILITY AND PROXIMITY 
Accessibility to public transit was initially measured in several ways. First, a count of the number of  metro stations and commuter train stations in the cell, secondly cells with their centroid within 800  meters of a station were deemed to be "accessible". As bus stop data were only available for the island  of Montral, two proxies were used, a dummy variable for "Bus route in Cell" and a count of the number  of bus routes. It should be noted that this count does not take into account the actual number of buses  that go through a particular cell per day or at what time. This could be useful in future studies. Many  studies have highlighted the importance of accessibility to transit in predicting use (Tsai 2008). 
URBAN FORM  
Related to the issues of accessibility above, the length of train track in each cell was also measured. In  addition, the total lengths of road, as well as the separate length of local roads, major roads and  expressways were also measured. This is to account for the obvious differences between the character  of a cell with 200 metres of lowspeed local street versus one with 200 metres of highway. These  variables were selected as they have been shown to impact residential choices. In addition, the census  provided variables on the number of various dwelling types and year of construction. 
NOTES ON DATA  
The census data is, by its nature, aggregate. However, particularly for population characteristics, efforts  have been made to optimize accuracy. For example, population estimates were performed in GIS by  intersecting residential land use with the grid cells, in this manner, the percentage of residential land use in any given cell could easily be calculated. In other words, the process does not presume that the  population is evenly spread out through the census tract, parks, water, industrial and other non residential land are removed from the analysis of population characteristics. 
In addition, variables such as average rent, average value, bedrooms etc were calculated as a weighted  average for cells that straddle more than one census tract and were given zero values for those parts of  census tract entirely in water, park or open land. 
Figure 4 show the importance of examining neighbouring cells. While the highlighted cells in each group  might have similar characteristics, the great variation in the neighbouring cells will give the cells their  different cluster characteristic.  Each group is similar in one aspect, commercial, residential or street  characteristics. However, a simple look at the surrounding cells make it apparent how important it is to  look at the context. In the first group for example, the two middle cells might have an identical amount  of commercial activity but their surrounding cells differentiate them easily.

INDIVIDUAL AND HOUSEHOLD DATA 
This experiment makes use of several data sources with varying degrees of aggregation. On a totally  disaggregate level, information on the individual traveller is known from the OD survey. The variables  used in the final regression are the age and  gender of the individual, number of people in household,  number of trips by the individual, number of trips made by the household and the start time of the trip.  The OD survey also provides precise X and Y coordinates for both ends of the trip. In addition to using  this as the basis of the Factor and Cluster analysis, data on trip length is also calculated from this  dataset. A schematic of the structure of the experiment is shown in Figure 5.

FACTOR AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS 
GENERAL 
Factor Analysis has one chief goal: to describe the covariance among many variables in terms of a much  smaller number of underlying random quantities that are referred to as factors (Johnson, Wichern,  1988).  In other words, the analysis works to extract a smaller number of factors from a large data set,  while keeping the meaning and significance of the full data set. For this reason, it is often referred to as  a data reduction technique. This quality makes the technique most desirable for this research. It would  be unwieldy, if not impossible, to run the desired regression analysis with the full set of 127 landuse  and demographic variables at the point of origin and destination.   Another key feature of this approach is that it does not make any assumptions regarding geography.  This is an important part of this study as no assumptions are made that areas near each other are  necessarily more similar than areas quite distant. The goal is to find those grid cells that are the most  similar to each other regardless of location. However, spatial location will be dealt with dummy variables  and the dispersal of each cluster will be explained.   After an initial Factor and Cluster of all 223,000grid cells was seen to be lacking in the level of desired  detail, two solutions were attempted. First, all grid cells that were 100% Open land or Water were  removed from the grid cell analysis (they were however kept for the purpose of the neighbouring cells).  This result still lacked much of the detail that was needed in the analysis. See Figure 6.

Figure 6: Original Factor and Cluster Map 
The solution presented here was to run a separate Factor and Cluster analysis on Home and Work  locations. In this way, the 19 000 grid cells that are home to a traveler of which data is available from  the OD survey and the 9 200 cells that represent work locations were analyzed separately. A different  set of variables were shown to be significant for each process resulting in a map that clearly shows  differences between residential and workplace locations throughout the region. While this type of  analysis can have drawbacks, notably in researcher subjectivity, the results shown here are thought to a  useful way in which to understand regional urban form and settlement patterns.    
HOME LOCATIONS 
The first Factor analysis will look at the 19 879 residential cells in which Home to Work travel is known.  From an initial inputting of over 100 variables at the grid cell and neighbouring cell level, 67 variables  were shown to significantly explain variations in neighbourhood types. This includes 33 variables at the  grid cell and neighbouring cells plus distance form downtown. From these 15 factors were extracted  that jointly explain over 80% of the variation between cells.   The challenge of Factor analysis is in interpreting the results. The researcher must make meaningful  decisions about the implication of each factor based on the examination of which variables are the most  heavily loaded. In this case, the Factors were relatively easy to interpret, as each was defined by a  consistent set of variables. It is worth noting that in the vast majority of cases, the variable measured at  the cell level and neighbouring cells were found to be in the same factor. In a smaller number of cases, a  celllevel measurement was seen to be different from its surroundings, this is seen as strength in this  21

analysis as, for example cells with a high degree of retail within them are separated from cells that are  adjacent to heavy commercial activity. 

Before presenting the factor analysis, descriptive statistics on each variable are shown in Table 1. Note  that DMTI refers to DMTI Spatial Inc.; Stats Can refers to statistics Canada, the body in charge of the  Candian census. This Table only presents the data at the cell level. The Factor and Cluster also looked at  the surrounding cells, meaning that there are twice as many variables in the analysis. 

Factor One is dominated by the variables capturing population density in the form of total population,  number of dwellings, number of workers, and number of university graduates. It was thought the Factor  analysis might separate areas of socioeconomic difference as measured by levels of education;  however, this was not the case. This factor also includes the variable for proximity to downtown. 

Factor Two, in contrast is characterized by household information and captures large homes and large  families measured by the number of rooms, bedrooms, and children.

Factor Three includes the three variables meant to account for wealth and expensive real estate. It  includes average home value, average rent and median household income at both levels  cell and  neighbours. The fourth factor includes two variables, at both levels to account for commercial activity.  This variable is measured as the total area in square meters of land uses devoted to commercial activity  within the cell. Factors five and six are characterized by retail and services in the cell and surrounding  cells respectively. The difference between these two factors is important and will be examined further. 

Factor Seven captures the presence of parks and golf courses in and surrounding the cell. Factors eight  and nine measured industrial land use and commuter rail train access respectively. Factors ten through  fourteen each measure one variable at both levels: new construction, institutional land use, degree of  water frontage, and presence of train tracks and highway respectively. The last factor captures the  degree to which residences are owned.

Table 2 lists the factors with all variables, complete factor loadings can be found in Appendix I. Note that  each of these variables was measured at both the cell and surrounding cell level. The residential factor  and cluster analysis therefore utilized sixtyseven variables, thirtythree at both the cell and surrounding  cell level plus distance from downtown, which was only measured at the cell level as there would be  little to no variation in the cell distance and the average of the neighbouring cell distance.   The goal of using cluster analysis is to further refine the neighbourhood types regardless of spatial  location (Song and Knaap 2004). Kmeans cluster analysis is used to facilitate this. The process sorts each  cell into one of a predetermined number of clusters such that internal similarity is maximized while  similarities between groups are minimized.  The optimal number of Cluster categories extracted from the fifteen factors was found to be ten.  Although this resulted in one very small cluster, the overall effectiveness of this analysis far outweighed  the use of nine or fewer factors. Other amounts were found to not adequately describe differences in  urban form. Local knowledge of the region was useful in understanding the clusters as is often the case  in this type of analysis.  Each Cluster has  positive or negative  inputs from each factor; these are then used to understand the  characteristics of the cluster. Below are the names and a brief description of each cluster. These will be  mapped and graphed in much detail below. Figure 7 shows a graph of cluster Centroid values.

1 Park areas. The factor capturing park land and golf course is by far the biggest  contributor to this cluster, however, the second highest input capturing new  construction helps make sense of this group, newer residential areas fronting on  parkland.  

2 "Big Box Commercial". Again, with only factor overshadowing all others, this cluster is  relatively easy to interpret. Noteworthy absences include; retail and highway, this helps  to differentiate between commercial streets with a higher concentration of smallscale  shops with good accessibility.  

3 Commuter Train Access. with three positive inputs, train tracks, commuter rail stations  and industrial land, this cluster corresponds with areas of high accessibility to the  commuter train system.

High Density Residential. Characterized by population density and smaller household  size, perhaps most importantly it is negative in retail and services, easily differentiating  itself from the urban mixed use category below. 
Newer High Density with poor retail access. This small cluster is characterized by newer  high density residential with poor access to commercial activities (note: this cluster is  much smaller than would be desired in Cluster analysis, however, the use of less than  ten clusters failed to capture the desired variations in urban form) 
Single Family Residential. While the graph might be initially difficult to interpret, an  examination of the positive inputs makes this cluster clear, with positive inputs from  household size, new construction, and the "no water" factor as well as negative  contributions from the retail services category; this is clearly single family homes with  poor retail access, the suburbs in other words. Not surprisingly, this is the largest of the  ten clusters, comprising roughly half of the residential clusters. Again, it is important to  note that not all of these grid cells are located geographically where one might be  tempted to assume. While they do tend to be farther away from downtown on average  (see spatial distribution section below) there is a wide dispersion of these cells both on  and off the island. 
This cluster is characterized by proximity to highways and retail services. 
Commercial Streets. Here the mapped output was quite helpful in defining the cluster. It  corresponds with Montral's main commercial streets such as StLaurent and StDenis.  It could also be thought of commercial/residential mixeduse as opposed to Cluster ten  below 
This cluster clearly describes waterfront property throughout the region. 
Urban mixed use. interestingly, while 4, 8, and 10 share many of the same factor  contributions, their relative strengths make their differences clear. This cluster is  dominated by high density residential with retail services nearby.

ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF RESIDENTIAL CLUSTERS 
Table 3 shows population, dwelling and density measures for each cluster. Interestingly, a high  percentage of the total population of the region is accounted for in the cells in the final analysis. Also, as  would be expected, this clearly shows the difference between the population and dwelling densities of  the various clusters. Waterfront and Park front areas have by far the lowest residential density,  predominantly singlefamily areas have a population and dwelling density roughly one third that of High  density urban; the difference between the Urban Mixed Use cells is even more dramatic.

household, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, as well as the lowest number of landuses. These  are shown as these variables have been shown to both influence residential choices and travel  behaviour. 

The final descriptive figure for the residential clusters concerns their spatial distribution, while this can  also be seen to some extent on the cluster map (Figure 8), Table 4 clearly shows how each cluster is  geographically located. While urban mixed use, high density residential, retail and job centers are  overwhelmingly located on the island, singlefamily and waterfront areas are located offisland.  However, it is also noteworthy that there are, in fact several dozen high density residential and a  handful of urban mixed use cells located offisland. Average distances from downtown and standard  deviations are also given. This information, along with the maps gives a highly detailed description of the  distribution of land uses, built form and demographic information throughout the region.

As established earlier, Montral is not a monocentric city; however it is interesting to note the spatial  dispersion of the clusters from downtown. These distances are measured from an "assumed  downtown", a point near the corner of Peel and Ren Lesvesque.

The combination of the factor and cluster outputs; demographic and geographic data; as well as the  regional and inset maps should give the reader a clear picture of the difference between these ten  residential clusters. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the grouping of the clusters in a regional and closeup  view respectively.

It is useful to zoom in a few areas to highlight the level of detail that this process was able to generate,  (Figure 9). There is a clear distinction between gridbased patterns and more curvilinear patterns in the  top map where the residential area to the west are identified as singlefamily and the higher density  areas to the east are  dentified as high density residential. More importantly, especially in the bottom  map, the more densely populated areas of Verdun are contrasted from less dense areas; in addition  waterfront areas and commercial are clearly seen. Also the areas around major highway infrastructure  are clearly visible. It is also clear that not all grid cells that touch water are automatically included in the  waterfront category, the totality of factor contributions lead to the final cluster grouping. 
WORK LOCATIONS 
For the purposes of this analysis, it was then necessary to repeat the process for the 9000 grid cells that  are a destination for a known trip in the OD survey. While the same variables were initially inputted,  the process showed different variables to be significant in explaining the variation between work cells. A  brief description of the factor analysis and cluster results is given below. The Appendix I contains the full  factor loadings. First, descriptive statistics are given for all variables in all 9,034 grid cells (Table 5). The  work location factor and cluster analysis includes thirtysix variables at both levels plus distance for a  total of seventythree variables. As with the residential analysis, fifteen factors were extracted from the  factor analysis. 
Factor one is made up a variables that describe pre1946, mostly residential areas capturing variables  such as population and dwelling density.  
Factor two is a bipolar factor as it has both positive and negative loadings, negative for industrial land  use and positive for those variables that capture singlefamily neighbourhood characteristics. Some of  these variables include residential land use, number of children, average number of people per  household, median income, and average value of dwelling. This clearly makes this a factor to describe  nonindustrial residential areas with predominatelylarger homes. 
Factor three captures commercial land use, but not job or retail concentrations. Factor four corresponds  to highway length and bus service. As mentioned above, the bus variable was captured by the length of  bus lane in the cell not as a count of actual bus stops. The major input of the fifth factor is the length of  local roads; the total length of roads (which includes local roads) makes a less significant input. 
The next two factors comprise parks and golf course, and commuter train service respectively. The  eighth factor captures residential areas with three separate measurements, amount of residential land  use and the number of singledetached homes in the cell and surrounding cells. Open space at the cell  and neighbouring level comprise factor nine. Factor ten is made up of three counts of job at the census  level, total jobs, manufacturing jobs and management jobs. In contrast, factor eleven includes the total  number of retail and professional jobs. It is important to note that, as an accurate point file was not  available, these employment numbers were only available at the census tract level.

Factor twelve describes Institutional and government land use, while thirteen counts service  accessibility in the form of a count of retail and restaurants in the cell. In addition, the last two factors  describe waterfront areas and newer areas respectively.

 As with the residential clustering, the important information comes out in the clustering. Again, the  analysis is undertaken on two levels, interpretation of the output graphs and confirming the meaning of  the clusters on the mapped outputs. 
Figure 10 shows the cluster centroid values, the predominance of one factor for most clusters, this  makes interpretation easier. It is worth noting again that, while some of the names for the residential  and work cluster are similar, there are important differences between them. 
1 Isolated Suburban Retail areas. The first cluster is, in fact, one of the most difficult to make  sense of. With high positive inputs from the park land use as well as the factor capturing both  high levels of both retail and profesional employment, this cluster describes relatively isolated  areas of employment in otherwise park or open space.  
2 Waterfront. The measurement of water is by far the biggest factor in this cluster, a high score  for highway makes this cluster job areas near highways and water. 
3 Mixed Use Commercial and Residential 
4 Suburban office park,s Isolated Retail and Commercial areas near parks and golf, higher input  from the professional and retail job concentrations point towards. 
5 "Suburban" areas. Although this cluster is negative in all factors that capture employment and  services and positive in lowdensity residential factors, there are obviously some employment  oppurtunities, as each cell is the destination of a work trip.  
6 "Big Box Commercial" characterized by commercial land use near major roads, with positive (but  small inputs of employment) 
7 With the highest loading from the train accessibility factors, this cluster is labelled Train.

While the work location map is not as easy to "read" as the residential  maps, its usefulness will soon be  shown. One closeup of downtown is presented below, clearly visible is the job concentration that easily  accessible to train and transit, as well as the McGill University campus which can be seen in purple  Institutional. Also shown are the mixed use area to the southwest of the campus and a few cells of  Westmount, an upscale mostly residential area. 
MAJOR FINDINGS 
This section is divided into several sections. First, some general findings to describe Montral regional  commuting will be presented. This is itself divided into two sections, mode and trip length, which is  presented in a geographic, demographic and cluster based manner. These findings will be helpful in  understanding the more complex and thorough analysis that will address the issue of trip length. 
MODE 
Before moving on to the analysis of trip lengths, an analysis and discussion of mode choice will be  presented.  
GEOGRAPHIC 
Having a clear picture of the nature of commuting in the region will be helpful in understanding the  statistical models developed below. This study looked at hometowork commuting trips that did not  feature a major mode shift, from car to transit for example. Trips that used two different types of public  transit, bus to metro, for example, were included. Of the 49,650 work trips that fit these criteria, the  modal split is as follows, Car (driver or passenger) 77.15%, transit (all forms) 17.07% and active (walking  or biking) 5.78%. Numbers available through Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada 2008) based on the  20% "long form" census questionnaire show slightly different figures (see Table 6), nonetheless, it is  interesting to contrast the modal split for Montreal versus the rest of the province and Country. 
While the automobile still dominates the commute, Montral has a noteworthy use of alternative  modes of transport, especially in comparison to many North American cities. Please see Appendix III for  further breakdown by mode. While 23% percent noncar commuting would be impressive by itself by  North American standards, looking at the subregions, it is even more so. 
While transit and active modes of transportation play a significant role in the mobility in the region, it is  worth noting the geographical differences in mode choice in different subregions (Table 6). For work  trips that begin and end on the island, only 59% are by car. As expected, transit use declines  dramatically offisland, particularly for intrasuburban trips.

DEMOGRAPHIC 
There are also noteworthy differences between males and females. Women are much more likely to  take transit to work than men; conversely men are almost twice as likely to cycle to work (see Table V  Appendix III). As will be shown in the regression models, income is also highly correlated with mode  choice. This can also be seen in Figure 12. While car and transit use are relatively similar for those in the  lowest income bracket, a wide difference quickly grows as income rises.

Some important findings include the fact that a full 9.6% of those who both live and work on the island  use active transport, while the number is, a still impressive, 7% for Laval. In addition, car use for  Montral island residents is significantly lower than the regional average. 
CLUSTER 
This section will present a basic Clusterbased analysis. The small relative size of the New High Density  Cluster makes interpreting trip length data from this cluster delicate. The preceding section served to  present modal choice as a function of demographic and geographic characteristics, however, the focus  of this research is on the relationship of the identified clusters and travel behaviour. 

There are remarkable differences between the destinations of transit versus car trips. While areas of  high train accessibility only make up 11% of car trips, they account for a full 31% of transit trips. In  contrast, while suburban areas attract 24% of car trips, only 10.4% transit trips go there. This is  illustrated in Table 7.

CAR COMMUTES BY CLUSTER 
The following section gives a sense of the Origins and Destination for car work trips. The total number of  trips that begin or end by cluster is given along with the percentage that that represents of all trips as  well as the average distance of commutes. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of trips, 87% of all trips  originate in the three clusters of singlefamily, urban mixeduse and high density residential; single family areas alone account for roughly 54% of all trips. This, however, is simply a reflection of the  number of cells in each cluster and the relative residential density; it tells us little without also  examining the destination cluster information. This can be seen  in absolute numbers  in Table 9. 
Average trips lengths vary considerably, trips from urban mixed use areas are approximately half as long  as those from waterfront areas and singlefamily areas, and roughly a third less than park areas and the  highway cluster. Highdensity and urban mixeduse have travel much shorter distances. This would seem  to confirm assumptions about higher densities and travel behaviour. 
Examining average clustertocluster trip distances reveals more. The average length for urban mixed  use and highdensity residential and commercial streets is roughly half that of suburban, waterfront and  park areas. In other words, residents of urban mixed use areas tend to live twice as close on average as  those living in suburban areas. 
Looking at the destinations, the most immediate difference is that the clusters contribute more evenly  to the total count than was the case with the origins. Job centres and Suburban areas account for most  of the trips, with Institutional areas, high density residential and train areas each contributing roughly  10% each. Though less striking than the differences between residential areas, it is worth pointing out  that Job centers draw people in from the farthest distance. These ideas will be expanded upon below 
The destinations of train, Institutional and job centre are shown to be the attracters with the longest trip  length. This can be seen in Table 10. The destination distances do not tell quite so clear a story at first  glance. While job centres exhibit the longest trips in which would seem to confirm basic economic  theory of competition among workers, the other clusters are more difficult to read. High density  residential, for example draw drivers from a greater average distance than the suburbs. While at first  this might seem counterintuitive, it is important to bear in mind that this might simply be capturing the  "attractive" power of high density areas versus suburban, low density areas. We saw above that  suburbanites do drive longer distances, the breakdown of cluster pairs will help to make sense of this.

Table 12 The ten shortest average car commute distances 

Tables 11 and 12 tell an interesting story. Table 11 shows the ten most common clustertocluster  commutes along with their average distances and the percentage that these clusters represent of all  trips. The most common commute is single family to job centre, this is also one of the longest average  commutes at over 18 km. Most of these commutes have a long distance associated with them.  Noteworthy is the length of highdensity to highdensity commutes with an average length of just 7.9  km. Table 12, on the other hand, shows the ten shortest commutes. In this we see that most of these  combinations are also quite rare with the exception of high density to high density and urban mixed use  to high density. In other words, the shortest distances by cluster combinations are, unfortunately, not  common, while the most common combinations are, on average, quite long. 

Remy Barbonnne (2007), in fascinating work on the Plateau, a gentrifying area of Montral, found  similar results. Whereas, residents of the area were predominantly working nearby in creative and  technical sector jobs and walking, cycling and using public transit, most of the workers who worked the  service jobs in the area were commuting longer distances, often by car. It is this in/out that must be  41

considered in any discussion of the relative effectiveness of any land use policies to combat car usage  and emissions. This will be discussed further below. 
CAR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
To better understand and analyse much of the above information, a multivariate linear regression  model was developed with length of trip as the dependent variable and the individual, household,  cluster and geographical data as independent variables. The goal of multivariate regression analysis is  to understand the relationships between several independent variables and a dependent variable, here  trip length. The results are shown below. The results are interesting and point towards the usefulness of  this approach.  
Two models are presented here: a "base" model that only looks at demographic information of the  individual and household, and an "expanded" model that includes dummy variables for home and work  cluster as well as geographic variables. While the basic model performs poorly (with an R Square of  .061), the sign and magnitude of the variables is educational. The expanded model performs much  better and gives important insight into regional travel behaviour as seen in Table 13. The increase in the  R square  from .061 to .392  resulting from the addition of the cluster and geographic variables shows  the importance of using these nondemographic variables. 
The results of the preliminary regression were as expected. Total number of trips by household, total  number of trips by individual, low income dummy, and age squared all had a negative coefficient. In  addition, and slightly more surprising, the AM peak dummy sign was also negative, perhaps suggesting  that the AM peak congestion cost in time is having an effect on trip lengths, with commuters either  making longer trips at other times of the day or taking other modes for longer peakhour commutes.  The variables that capture household size, wealth, number of cars, fulltime status and age were all  positive.  
The origin clusters of park, big box, train, highway, singlefamily, and waterfront were all shown to be  significant at the 99% level with a positive sign in relation to the omitted variable of high density  residential origin. The distance added is noteworthy. For example, commutes from single family and  park origins are shown to be 4.5 km and 3 km longer than high density residential respectively.  Urban  mixed use origins are significantly correlated with commutes of almost a kilometre shorter than high  density residential; this is the only origin cluster seen to be negatively correlated with commute lengths.  New high density and commercial streets are not shown to be significantly correlated with trip length in  relation to the omitted high density cluster. It is again worth noting that the small size of new high  density origins makes this delicate to interpret.  
The destination clusters of waterfront, big box, train, institutional and job centres are all correlated with  longer work trips. However, the effect on trip length is not as strong as the origin clusters. For example,  train, institutional and jobcentre destinations are shown to increase trip length by only roughly 1.5 km.  This would seem to suggest that the origin of a work trip plays a more important role in determining trip 
42 
 

Neighbourhood level determinants on mode choice and distance for homebased work trips in the Montral region                              K. Manaugh 
length. Perhaps this points to the importance of understanding residential choice in discussions of  commuting length. 
It is also worth noting that some unexpected outcomes were found for both suburban and high density  residential mixed use areas. New high density destinations are not shown to be significant relative to  high density destinations in predicting commute length. In addition, while singlefamily origins generate  much longer trips, suburban destinations are not shown to be correlated with longer commutes. 
These findings are also similar to Barbonne's work cited above. In fact, they are all the more interesting  as this study looks not just at one neighbourhood in a geographical sense but on a particular type of  neighbourhood that is scattered across the region. This point should be underlined, while urban mixed  use and high density residential clusters seem to be "exporting" shorter and "better" i.e. transit and  active trips, these types of areas are "importing" longer car trips. Most noteworthy is the fact that the  average length of car trips to high density areas is actually longer than the average car trip to a suburban  location. Also noteworthy is the fact the average distance of singlefamily to suburbs is well below the  average distance of all hometowork car trips of 14 km. Please refer to Table 10. 
The significance and magnitude of the geographic dummies are also important. Trips that stay in one  subregion, that is do not cross a bridge, are significantly shorter. While this is somewhat intuitive, it is  important to point out the each subregion is quite large; the island is roughly 51 network km from tip to  tip. In addition the North and South Shore regions are each larger than the island of Montreal. The  coefficients also suggest that both living and working in Laval has the strongest negative effect on trip  lengths.

STUDY LIMITATIONS 
As with any study, this research was faced with several issues, these will be discussed below. While the  technique of factor and cluster has been shown to be an effective way of reducing large datasets and  revealing hidden factors, it also has some inherent weaknesses. As mentioned briefly above, these  include researching subjectivity, particularly in the naming of both the factors and clusters, and certain  unwieldiness in its adaptability. For example, unlike a simple regression model in which a variable can  simply be inserted or deleted, the nature of the factor and cluster analysis requires hours of computing  time and analysis if one is to add or remove data and/or variables. In this research, variables that might  have improved the overall performance of the model were, in fact, not included as they were located  well after the analysis was completed. 
In addition, this technique is a powerful way to reduce very large datasets to something both  meaningful and practical. It proved quite effective at doing just that in this study. However, it should be  noted that it is not necessarily the best, and certainly not the only way to approach neighbourhood and  urban form analysis. It could be argued that a smaller sample of neighbourhoods with a variety of  quantitative and qualitative approaches could give more accurate  though it would certainly be much  smaller in scope  results than this research. However, the tradeoff between being able to analyse such  a large amount of individual trips and areas and looking at a small fraction of the information, made this  approach desirable. A casestudy approach would have also allowed for the inclusion of other important  information, traveller attitudes, and employer policies in regards to parking, whether transit passes are  included in a benefit package, past travel patterns and residential location information. This, needless to  say, was not included in the present analysis. Having said that, as the point of this research was on  urban form, many of the above criticisms are a bit extreme. Other data that could be useful are accurate  travel time differentials between car and transit trips as well as transit costs by region.

The last point is data accessibility. Although this study was able to make use of an incredibly wide range  of data sources of very high quality and accuracy, some important data were missing and/or incomplete.  Two important examples are the fact that both bus stop locations and cycle lane data were only  available for the island of Montral. Cycle lane information was dropped entirely from the analysis due  to consistency while number of individual bus lines and a dummy variable capturing whether a bus  passes through a particular cell were used instead. Other data that could have proved useful include  parking availability and rates, traffic counts and accurate transit times for all trips. In addition metro and  train locations were given simply by a point in a GIS shapefile, no information on the physical location of  entryways, let alone any kind of information on stairs, escalators or elevators was available. As ride sharing and increasing  vehicle occupancy are effective ways in which to lower overall VMT, data on  vehicle occupancy would also be of interest to researchers. I did not have access to this data from the  Montral OD survey. In addition, while I feel confident that exploring weekday hometowork trips only  is a valid approach, it must be noted that other trip purposes and weekend travel could make these  types of studies even more robust. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper first develops a useful and easy way in which to visualize and characterize urban form, land  demographic, and accessibility measures for thousands of home and work locations throughout the  region of Montral using factor and cluster analysis. The factor and cluster analysis is interesting in its  own right and even more so for its help in understanding regional travel behaviour. By revealing deeper  patterns of urban form, the analysis shows that how certain neighbourhood typologies are spatially  spread out throughout the region. 
Using detailed individual, household and geographical information, individual trips are analysed in the  context of the land use measures at the point of origin and destination. This allows for the development  of a linear regression to predict length of travel by automobile for hometowork trips. The  characteristics at the point of origin coupled with demographic information go a long way in  understanding trip length. Furthermore, while most of the findings here are supported by previous  research, many noteworthy findings were also extracted. In addition, many intuitive but nonetheless  important findings are also presented. 
The paper also shows the importance of demographics and households and as well as  the unobserved  preferences of travellers  the cluster information alone, while quite useful does not allow the  researcher to make the type of conclusions and analysis that are possible with the full data set.  However, it is interesting that this research confirms many claims made by advocates of neighbourhood  design effects on travel. Here we see that people who live in denser neighbourhoods, regardless of  geography have different travel behaviour than those who live in predominantly singlefamily areas  regardless if they are on the island or in farflung suburban areas. What this research is unable to do, is  make claims about the causality of any of these findings. As many have discovered before, this is the  most difficult aspect this type of research. While it is hoped that this paper can add to the understanding

Neighbourhood level determinants on mode choice and distance for homebased work trips in the Montral region                              K. Manaugh 
about the complex relationship between travel and neighbourhood design, without the understanding  of individual travel preferences and location choice decisions, it becomes nearimpossible to make any  claims other than to describe and attempt to make sense of the data. 
However, with a very large number of observations, a setup that takes into account microscale (cell),  smallscale (neighbouring cells) as well as censustract level demographic data, dummy variables to  account for geographic location in addition to the disaggregate data available for the individual as well  as the household, it seems clear that this research is able to make some interesting insights into the  debate over urban form and travel behaviour on a regional scale. While a basic geographic analysis  seems to confirm assumptions about "downtown" versus "surburban" travel behaviour, the cluster  analysis reveals more subtlety. Furthermore, it seems that certain issues of behaviour can be  generalized based on neighbourhood types. In addition, this study opens up many avenues for future  study.  
POLICY IMPLICATIONS 
This section presents policy implications of this research and points towards further issues to explore.  Commutes crossing bridges to the island of Montreal are the longest trips in the region. This has several  implications: These trips therefore contribute a higher amount of pollution based on their VMT, but,  because they are forced to go over one of fourteen bridges, are also responsible for increased  congestion. These reasons would support the  contentious  idea that bridge tolls should be  implemented, that transit should increase its regional offer and that higher concentrations of  employment opportunities should be encouraged in suburban locations. However as Badoe and Miller  (2000) point out, efforts to increase transit use are often not as effective as desired. They cite Webber   (1976) who found that most users of BART after one year of operation had previously taken the bus. The  idea of bridge tolls in Montral has also been met with strong opposition. Yet it seems to have potential  to be one of the most effective ways to decrease VMT in the Montreal region. 
SuburbtoSuburb commuting is both quite prevalent and predominantly car dominated, however it is  far from the longest commute in the region. However, in contrast to the singlefamilytosuburban  travel, most car trips that originate in single family areas or go to job centres are much longer than other  trips. This also seems to confirm the usefulness of having a better mix of jobs and residences in the  suburbs. Both of these findings point towards the importance of a better mix of employment and  residences in the suburbs. 
Many assumptions are upheld in this analysis, residents of dense mixeduse travel shorter distances by  "better" modes of transportation. However, these areas also bring in travelers from long distances,  including many by car. Of special interest is the dissonance between trips in and out of certain types of  areas. In particular, the fact that while commutes from high density residential are shown to be shorter  and less carcentric, many of the commutes into high density areas are, in fact, longer than the regional  average. Of course, it must be noted that, due to the setup of this research, the actual geographic  location of these clusters does not come into play. That is, I cannot claim that a particular cell generates  longer trips than it attracts, for example, simply that home and work clusters identified as high density  47

show remarkably different in and out behaviour. Also apparent from the transit use figures is the fact  that transit needs to be easily accessible at both ends of a trip to be a practical possibility.     "Suburban type development" is more spread out spatially than often thought. The geographical spatial  distribution of clusters is also noteworthy in its own right and gives a nuanced picture of regional home  and work locations. In addition, the fact that "suburban" travel behaviour is relatively consistent  regardless of geography is noteworthy. In fact, perhaps the most intriguing issue brought up here is the  fact that the type of neighbourhood cluster does a relatively decent job of estimating travel behaviour  when geography is controlled for.   Reducing VMT will require investment in transit infrastructure, education and policies to encourage  growth in already established corridors and TODs. As the demographic analysis showed, it is  predominantly wealthy males over the age of thirtyfive who are contributing the largest share of VMT  in the region. While I cannot claim to offer a solution, it seems that in addition to the many options  already suggested to combat VMT, that some sort of targeted marketing or educational program  targeting that demographic might have some success. As Kitamura et al. proposed in 1997, a thorough  understanding of how travel attitudes are formed, how they relate to residential and workplace location  decisions and vehicle acquisition decisions and lastly, how they can be altered by land use policy is  absolutely vital in any discussion of travel behaviour.   A strength of this research is the combination of both a cluster and geographical based approach,  while controlling for individual and household variables. It is noteworthy that certain clustertocluster  patterns are relatively consistent regardless of geography and that, perhaps, certain key issues of  regional patterns are best understood by geographic criteria; the length of intraLaval trips and "crossing  bridge" are the clearest examples.

APPENDIX II ADDITIONAL TRANSIT ANALYSIS 
 

Transit Modal Split 

Of the 8489 transit trips looked at, 2200 are by Metro, 397 by Train and 5724 are by Bus, including STM as well  as the other five regional bus providers. High Density Residential generates by far the most transit trips,  followed by Single Family and Urban Mixed areas. Interestingly, while SingleFamily areas supply more than 50%  of the Train commutes, they are responsible for only 26% of the bus trips.  

By far the largest destination cluster for transit trips  for all modes  is the commuter train areas. These areas  also draw people in from the farthest average distance, almost twelve kilometres. This confirms prior research  and basic economic theory, being faster and more comfortable, a twelve kilometre train commute would be  significantly more attractive than a twelve kilometre bus trip.   

The largest single cluster pair is High Density Residential to Train, these trips account for 12% of all regional  transit trips. Other important cluster pairs are Single Family to Train, Urban Mixed Use to Train, Urban Mixed  Use to High Density Residential and High Density Residential to High Density. 

Different transit modes are responsible for drastically different travel distances, as seen in Table 10.

Table i: Transit Modal Split and Distance 

There is a wide variance in the distance of transit trips by cluster of Origin. Urban Mixed Use areas have a  shorter transit commute by less than half in relation to Waterfront, Park and Single Family areas. High density  residential, commercial streets and Train areas also exhibit significantly shorter transit distances. It is especially  interesting to contrast the difference between the origins of car and transit trips. For example, while Urban  Mixed Use areas and High Density Residential are only responsible for 38.7% of all trips, they generate 62.8% of  transit trips. There is a notable contrast between SingleFamily areas which generate 47.7% of all trips yet only  20.7% of transit trips. There is a remarkable difference in the distance in and out of the clusters. While the  distances into the destinations clusters are somewhat, surprisingly, similar, Institutional, Train and Job Centre  attract the longest trips. Also the difference between transit trips coming from the Train Residential cluster and

The single longest transit distance is Waterfront areas to High Density Residential. See Appendix for additional  figures with additional breakdown into mode. It is also interesting to note that areas identified as Train work  locations actually have a much higher percentage of bus trips ending there. This might reveal more about the  nature of the Montral transit system than anything else, namely that most Commuter Train stations downtown  are also served by the Metro and all of them are connected to bus service. 

A last finding concerning income, vehicle and ownership; while it is intuitive that wealthier households would  own more vehicles, and that most transit users would not be car owners, what is surprising is that vehicle  ownership appears to have a positive correlation with transit trip length. This might be related to perception of  distance for car owners or simply be a reflection of the difference in spatial distribution of low versus high  paying employment.  Table 12 shows the number of vehicles owned and average distance travelled.  A full 85%  of transit users come from a household with one or less vehicles. Somewhat promising for transit use, however,  is the fact that 12% of households using transit for work trips own two vehicles. While it is well beyond the  scope of the current paper to explore this further, it is obvious that this dataset could be examined further with  regards to income, gender, dualearner household, car ownership and transit use.
