ABSTRACT 
 Deep Discount Group Pass (DDGP) programs are innovative fare reduction techniques that encourage people to leave their cars at home and take public transit instead. This modal transfer can offset many issues encountered by an institution, itsmembersandthetransitauthoritywhilegeneratingbenefits forall. Thecurrentresearchexaminestherealadvantagesforpartners involved in the context of a university transit pass (UPass) implemented at the Universit de Sherbrooke (UdeS). After having implemented the UPass, students from the university who traveled by car either switched to transit (switchers) or continuedtousetheircar(nonswitchers).Forouranalysiswe used data from the universitywide survey on student travel behavior, which we ran through the Random Forests (RF) classification method to identify both dominant profile and opinion variables responsible for switching and not switching to transit. Our analysis shows that the 31% increase in public transit modal share was generated by students who typically studyintheology,ethicsandphilosophy,physicaleducationor human sciences; live relatively close to UdeS; do not have access to a car; chose their place of residence based on proximity to transit or their study area; were car passengers prior to the UPass; are in their first and second year of undergraduate studies; are 28 years of age and younger, and areparttimeworkers. By identifying the dominant characteristics of switchers, the study allows other academic institutions to estimate the success rate of a future UPass by calculating the number of potentialswitchers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In Canada, the federal government is pressuring universities to implement sustainability programsandreducetheircarbonfootprints.Morethanever,universitiesmustadapttheir activities and implement new practices around the principle of sustainability. In our relatively affluent society, the car remains a status symbol despite its negative impacts on the environment. This raises the challenge to make public transport more attractive. For universities, finding innovative Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies for studentsandstaffshouldbeattheforefrontofitspreoccupations. 
DDGP programs are innovative fare reduction techniques that encourage people to leave their cars at home and take public transit instead. This modal transfer can offset commonissuesencounteredbyaninstitution,itsmembersandthetransitauthoritywhile generatingbenefitsforall. 
This work examines the real advantages for partners involved in the context of a DDGP implemented at UdeS. We then suggest general improvements that can make these programs more attractive to a wider range of institutions. In addition, we draw from the complete profile of students who continued to use their cars in order for UdeS and other universities to better target their promotion campaign in order to exceed the 31 percent solution. 
For transit agencies, DDGP measures are particularly attractive due to insufficient funding sources to cover both running and maintenance costs, which prevents them from

focusingonotherdevelopmentopportunities.Frequently,agenciesresorttofareincreases inordertogenerateadditionalrevenueorcutbackonservicetoreduceoperationalcosts. Both of these measures result in reductions in ridership, consequently hurting their total revenue. "In order to avoid this downward spiral, turning to ridership increases as a startingpointseemstobepartofthesolutionagenciesareseeking"(Hester,2003,p.7). DDGP does not call for mere fare reductions but rather a shift in the way transit agencies collect their fare revenues. This measure adopts a similar scheme as group purchasing (made famous by firms such as Groupon). The concept is based on offering a significant rebate on a bulk purchase made by multiple customers. In the case of a UPass, the purchasedgoodisapassthatgrantsunlimitedaccesstotransitservicewhilethebuyersare generally students  or in some cases  all members of the university community. Universities are particularly well suited to buy into these programs since all its members shareacommonandhighdensitydestination.Also,studentsaregenerallyverysupportive of such a program, as they allocate a much larger portion of their annual income to transportation,makingthemparticularlysensitivetopricechanges.

Although the UPass at UdeS has effectively resolved transportation issues on campus and has been running successfully for 7 years, this measure has yet to be reproducedelsewhereinQuebec.Mostuniversitiesarestillunawareofthegainsavailable throughsuchaprogram. 
In summary, we seek answers to the following questions: What are the basic characteristics of a UPass program? What reasons make students switch to public transportation?Thisreportbeginswithaliteraturereviewonthereasonsforintroducinga UPassprogramincludinghowitworksandwhobenefitsfromitthroughacomparison of previous case studies. We then shift our attention to UdeS's program and its generated results. The following section presents the data and methodology used to conduct a Random Forests (RF) analysis. Finally, the conclusion presents a number of recommendations for UPass programs in general and improvements to Universit de Sherbrooke'sUPassprogram.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1. Terminology 
First, various generic terminologies are used to describe programs that offer discounted transit fares for a group of users. These terms refer to a particular aspect offered by the
3

programs: Deep Discount Group Pass (DDGP) (Nuworsoo, 2005), Group Transit Purchase Program (GTPP) (BlockSchachter and Attanucci, 2008) University Pass or UPass, (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998; Hester, 2004), Unlimited Access (Brown et al., 2001, 2003; Isler and Hoel, 2004), Farefree transit (Brown et al., 2003; Boyd, et al., 2003), EcoPass (Shoup, workingpaper).Inthisstudy,universitybasedprogramswillgenericallybereferredtoas UPass, neighborhood and employerbased programs will be referred to as EcoPass, and jointly they will be referred to as DDGP. Although the bulk of this study examines universitybased programs, the model holds potential to be further developed in other contextssuchasinstitutions,companiesandneighborhoods. 
2.2. Why implement a UPass? 
Universities are large institutions that generate important traffic flows. Continuous increases in student enrolment exacerbate issues on campuses. Universities are struggling between keeping up with the rising demand for parking and the need to adopt more sustainableapproaches.Meanwhile,transitagenciesaretryingtofindnewwaysofcovering their operating expenses without resolving to harmful measures such as fare increases or servicereductions(MeyerandBeimborn,1998). 
University pass programs hold the potential to create a winning situation for all participants, whether student, the university or the transit authority. While a further section will thoroughly describe all benefits for the parties involved, it is important to highlight the context of their implementation and their distinction over existing price strategies.

AUPassisconsideredaneffectiveTransportDemandManagement(TDM)solution that contains two sets of benefits. First, it ameliorates student accessibility to transit by cutting down the cost of traveling by bus, which results in ridership increases. For the transit agency the UPass represents secured revenues and a step forward to provide new andimprovedservicetothebenefitofstudentsandotherusers.Thesecondsetofbenefits involves parking rate increases at the university and acts as a disincentive measure. By discouraging students to travel to university by car, parking and accessibility issues are partlyrelieved. 
AspointedoutbyHester(2004)ashiftinfarepolicytrendshaswidenedthenumber of differential fare options to the detriment of the flat base fare. Differential fare options range from zone identifications and peak/offpeak periods to bulk purchases and prepaid optionsforlimitedperiodsoftime,suchasaday,aweek,amonth,etc.Inmostcases,these differentialfares impose usage restrictionsto the use ofpublic transportation.This is the transitagency'swayofapplyingacommonmarketingstrategythatconsistsofsegmenting the market of demand through several buying options.  These fare options hold the potentialtoincreasetransitridership.Theyareattractivetousersastheyofferadiscount over singleride fare and eliminate the burden of having the exact change to pay for every entry (Nuworsoo, 2005; Meyer, 1998). In turn, the adoption of these new fare structures reducesoperationalcostsfortheagencyasitreducesthenumberofindividualtransactions (Brownetal.,2001).

DDGP programs are innovative fare policies the university can build on to increase positive outcomes. The following section describes the nuts and bolts of how DDGP programsworkwithafocusonuniversitybasedprograms. 
2.3. How UPass and DDGP programs work? 
ThemainpurposeofDDGPprogramsistoprovideanewwayofpayingfortransit(Brown et al., 2003). The pricing schemes used in UPass programs will be addressed more thoroughlyinsection2.5.ThecommonelementrequiredtoimplementaDDGPprogramis tohaveallmembersbepartofacommongroupand,insomecases,shareacommonorigin or destination. Therefore, three types of locationbased programs have been developed: campusbased, employerbased and neighborhoodbased programs (Nuworsoo, 2005). In these cases, the university, the employer or the neighborhood association pays the yearly cost of the service to the transit authority in a single transaction. Then, participants of the program typically contribute for a part of the costs through university fees, payroll deductionsorinscriptionfees.  WithregardstothemainelementsofDDGPprograms,threeareconsistentlypresent: (1)Coverageforallmembersofanidentifiedgroup; (2) Unlimited access to transit for all group members during a predetermined period; and (3)Drasticallydiscountedfarescomparedtoregularpassprices. Also,someemployerbasedprogramsofferanemergencyridehome(Nuworsoo,2005).

Universities offer the perfect setting in which to implement a DDGP program. They representalargenumberofpeopletravelingtothesamedestination,andstudentstendto be more responsive to cheap transportation options and initiatives that benefit the environment.Forthisreason,discountedtransitpasseshavebeenmorewidelydeveloped in university contexts than in any other large institutions or employers (Hester, 2004). By 2002,morethan60UPassprogramsexistedintheUnitedStates(Shoup,workingpaper), while20hadmadetheirappearanceby2004inCanada(UPassToolkit,2004). 
Three types of university coverage options exist: optin, optout and mandatory participation (Hester, 2004). The optin coverage allows students to enroll in the program onavoluntarybasis.Thismethodissubjecttoattractonlycaptiveriders1,whichareriders that are already used to taking transit. Leaving out choice riders (or occasional riders) and potentialriders,generallycardriversoractivetransportusers,minimizesthepossibilityof increasingridership.Inturn,itholdstheriskofbecomingaviciouscirclewherealowlevel of participation leads to a higher, unattractive price. The optout coverage automatically enrolls all students, but with the option of optingout if desired. This method is subject to keepbothcaptiveandchoiceriderswhilepotentialriderswillhaveatendencyofoptingout, resulting in higher cost per participant. Finally, mandatory participation automatically enrolls all students, but without the option of optingout. This method makes individual cost per participant the lowest of all as the total expenditure can be divided between a larger number of participants. With a lower fare price, transit services can hope to also  1KevinJ.KrizekandAhmedElGeneidydividepublictransitridersintoeightcategories:"themarketfor

Also, more ridership justifies service improvements that will benefitalltransitusers.Translink,thetransitauthorityforthecityofVancouver,hasmade mandatory programs a prerequisite for providing service to any institution with a DDGP program2.

2.4. A business model 

2.4.1. Pricing scheme established by the transit agency   Discounted transit fares are a common marketing strategy. Transit authorities apply these to increase the sale value of each of their transactions. The model is based on bulk purchases of transit tickets or passes. The reducedfare is proportional to the amount of tickets purchased in one transaction or the amount of time during which the pass is valid. For instance, at the Socit de Transport deMontral (STM), Montreal's transit authority, theweeklypassoffersaminimumof27percentdiscountwhencomparedto5roundtrips using regular tickets that are priced at 3$ (5(weekdays) x 2(for roundtrip) x 3$). When buyingforalongerperiodoftime,themonthlypassoffersa39percentdiscountcompared to 40 regular priced tickets (1,80$/ticket instead of 3$)3. Conventional transit passes are priced to reflect frequent riders' needs, to provide a more affordable option to the regular fare,andtorecognizetheirliabilityascustomers.

Because they target frequent users, these passes suffer from adverse selection (Brown et al., 2001). Adverse selection is the term used in the context of insurance coverage. It refers to the increase of insurance premiums for every person insured due to the tendency of people with higher probability of loss to purchase more insurance. In the case of transit passes, adverse selection occurs because frequent transit users are more likelytobuypasses.Basedonthishypothesis,transitagenciesmustadjustthepriceoftheir passesupward,whichmakesthemunattractiveforoccasionalusers. 
2.4.2. What elements contribute to lower the cost of UPass programs? 
Theliteraturehasidentifiedseveralkeyfactorsthathelptransitagencieslowerthecostof UPass programs (Brown et al., 2001, 2003; Hester, 2004): (a) bulk purchases, (b) maximizingtransitcapacity,(c)avoidingadverseselection.  a.Bulkpurchases Similar to conventional passes, UPass programs also obtain their discount through bulk purchases but with two main differences. First, the pass covers longer periods of time, typicallypaidforthewholesemesterorthewholeyearinadvance.Second,paymentofthe passisnolongermadethroughindividualtransactions,butinonetransactionbetweenthe university and the agency. This significantly reduces transaction costs, such as labor and printingexpenses,comparedtosellingindividualpasses.  
10 

b.Maximizingtransitcapacity Maximizing transit capacity is another way of reducing the costs of the program. A UPass can generate more revenues for the transit agency if no additional buses are required to accommodatenewusers,astheywillfillunusedcapacityonbuses.Theliteratureidentifies several cases where program members filled empty seats on routes that had excess capacity(CityofBerkeley'sEcoPassprogram,Nuworsoo,2005;UCSanDiego,Brownetal., 2001;UWMMilwaukee,MeyerandBeimborn,1998;CUBoulder,Hester,2004).
 UPassprogramshaveanaddedadvantage:itisknownthatstudentsaremorelikely than others to use transit during underused offpeak hours because of their irregular schedules (Brown et al., 2001). To illustrate this point, Brown et al. stated the case of the Chicago Transit Authority where it was found that "69 percent of all student transit rides were made during offpeak hours while only 52 percent of all transit rides were made during offpeak hours" (Brown et al., 2001: 16). Therefore, through a UPass program the transit agency reduces the cost per kilometer of a bus by simply filling empty seats on routesthathavealreadybeenpaidfor.  c.Avoidanceofadverseselection Adverseselectionisonlypresentinpartialcoverageprograms.Studentswhodecidetoopt in or not optout of the program are regular transit riders.  Since they were the most lucrativegroup of users for the transit agency prior to the program, the university has to matchtheagency'srevenueexpectedfromthosestudents.Consequently,theyincreasethe program's cost per person. In the case of a UPass implemented through mandatory
 11

participation, it is possible to avoid adverse selection and therefore lower the cost per person. If every student owns a transit pass, the costs will be split between frequent and infrequenttransitriders.
 Alloftheseelementscreatevariancesinthetransitauthority'scosteitherbecauseof administrative expenses or, most importantly, the requirement for additional bus service. Intheory,thehigherthebenefitsfromeachofthesefactorsare,thelowertheUPasscanbe priced. 

2.5. How are UPass programs priced?  

The cost paid by the university is determined according to two elements: (a) The probability of use and (b) The amount of service on the routes that will be served. These twoconditionsarepresentforallDDGPprograms. 
This point can easily be understood through the following table. It shows the Santa ClaraValleyTransportationAuthority's(VTA)EcoPassannualpricingbasedonlocationand numberofemployees.

 Universities generally proceed intwo ways to estimatethe probability of use from students. Transit agencies that have electronic card readers can benefit from precise boardingdata.Usingsmartcardtechnology,AutomaticPassengerCounters(APC)onboard busescompileinformationaboutstudentusageofthetransitsystem.Thistechniqueisthe mostprecisewayofdeterminingthecostperride.  Transit agencies that have not implemented a smart card system usually base their price on university enrolment numbers, which they combine to manually counted student boardings. This technique is less precise since no descending data is compiled, and it usuallyonlyleadstodeterminingtheapproximatecostperrider.  In any transit pass program, the revenues expected by the agency must be equal or higherthantherevenuesperceivedpriortotheprogram.Therefore,costsgeneratedbythe addition of buses or by the addition of new routes must be covered by the university (Nuworsoo,2005).Ifthelevelofservicehasnotchanged,chargesshouldremainthesame sincethecommunityhasalreadypaidfortheservice.

2.5.1. Lowering the costs  Brown's study (2001) unveiled that 23 out of the 35 investigated universities use student fees as their primary source to fund their UPass program. Another study by Daggett and Gutkowski(2003)with23universitiesrevealedthatonly39percentofprogramshaveseen theirfeesloweredbythecontributionoftheuniversity,while52percentoffacultyandstaff programshaveauniversitycontribution.Researchersexpressedtheirsurprise,sayingthat "Faculty and staff are considerably more able to pay a transit fare, i.e., the percentage of their annual income used for transportation is significantly lower than that of students" (DaggettandGutkowski,2003,p.28).OfficialsattheUniversityofMonash(Australia)also insistonstudentfinancialpreoccupationsandaddthatstudentsareatastageinlifewhen theyperceivethemselvesaslargelyindestructiblebutpoor,theyconcludedafterholding focusgroupswithstudents(CooperandMeiklejohn2003,p.6).   SincemostuniversitiesadoptaUPasstoimproveparkingoncampus(Brown,2001), making students pay the entire bill to resolve university transportation issues is inappropriate. Brown argues that since the university and its students benefit from the U Passtheyshouldbothcontributetoitsfinancing.Oncethetransitauthorityhasestablished thecostatwhichitiswillingtoprovidestudentswiththeUPass,theuniversityholdsthe power to apply different funding schemes to further lower the price for its students.

Havingtheuniversityparticipateinfinancingpartoftheprogramlowersthecostfor students, thus further increasing the likelihood of the program to be adopted at student referendums. Finally, as mentioned earlier, having the university subsidize the program through its parking revenue holds the added benefit of discouraging car use and can thus helpincreasethesuccessrateoftheUPass.

Also, this would increase the switching rate to public transit, as students will want to avoid paying for two transportationoptions(theUPassandthemodetheyusedpriortotheUPass). 
2.6.2. Quality requirements  Having established that a UPass results in significant savings, let us consider how these savings can be distributed.

2.7. Benefits of UPass programs 
2.7.1. For universities  An obvious benefit for universities comes from savings related to all infrastructures and facilities related to intensive use of cars by studentsand staff (ifthe latter are allowed to participate).Themostobvioussavinginvolvesspacededicatedtoparking,whichbecomes exceedingly expensive as more campuses require their land for office space and research facilities to accommodate larger student body, and as offcity campuses are increasingly embeddedinsprawlingsuburbs.Thedecreaseofdemandforparkinginducesbenefitsthat range from major financial relief due to a decrease in road and parking maintenance to avoiding building additional costly infrastructure. Since every student who switches from driving to taking transit to get to university results in one less car on campus, it becomes possible to reconvert parking spaces into academic facilities that could generate revenues insteadofcostorevengreenspace.Also,removingcarsfromcampushelpscreatethesafe and attractive atmosphere that universities want to promote in order to draw prospective students. 
Althoughexactnumbersmayvaryaccordingtothesizeoftheuniversityandnearby settlements, if a larger relative number of students may prefer to live offcampus in part becauseoflessercosts,improvingstudentmobilitythroughoutthecitybypublictransport can have a serious impact on required university residential facilities. If so, a lesser proportion of students may choose to stay on campus and thus relieve pressure on students'housinginfrastructure.

In recent years, a strong preference has emerged in developing environmentally friendly facilities. Universities are at the forefront of this societal demand and are trying very hard to expand the norms of durability and selfreliance to set examples for the community and attract attention by being exemplary corporate citizens. Thus, developing incentives that will refrain from individual car use and actively promote less environmentally damaging solutions, such as public transit or active transportation, will necessarilybepartofanyuniversity'spledgetoreduceitsoverallproductionofdirectand inducedGHGemissions.Turningthewholecampusintoashowcaseofanenvironmentally friendly settlement will enhance its reputation, will be considered a manifestation of intellectual dynamism of creativity and innovation, and will garner praise as an overall expression of respect for the community. Such a program, at least in their objectives, can only receive approbation of its students and capture the attention of future students, thus helpingtoretainandrecruitstudents(ToorandHavlick,2004).

Mostly,itincreasesthecostofusingaprivatevehicletogettoschool.Amongthebenefits, the most tangible would be the important cut in travel costs between 40 percent to 94 percent reduction on regular fare price (Nuworsoo, 2005). Programs are usually designed insuchawaythattheyallowforflexibility.Forexample,youmayusepublictransittorun anyerrandwithintheterritorycoveredbythetransportationsystemonanymomentofthe day, on any day of the week. As a result, being part of the student community subsidizes yournonstudentactivities.
 Lowcosttransitdoesmorethanjustallowstudentstopaylessmoneytocoveraset distance. UPass allows students to increase housing and shopping options giving them access to less expensive goods. To the extent that the increase in mobility is taking place through the use of transit, students cover more distance while fewer cars circulate on city streets. A UPass also has a positive impact on transportation equity, as it allows less fortunate individuals to spend less money on their transportation needs, thus liberating resourcesforotheruses(ToorandHavlick,2004).  Finally, a UPass offers the convenience to its participants of not needing to worry abouthavingexactchangeforthefarebox(Nuworsoo,2005;Meyer,1998).Campusbased programsusuallycombinestudentIDcardsandtransitpassesintoone,eitherbyupgrading toasmartcardsystemorthroughtheadditionofasticker.

Studentswhodonotswitch Nonswitching students are put at a disadvantage in a number of ways. First, since most programsdonotallowforoptingout,driversenduppayingtwicefortransportservices.As mentioned,mostuniversitieswhohaveadoptedaUPasssubsidizeitscostthroughparking revenues but often also increase these charges as a result of the additional expenses incurred.Thismeasuregivesanaddedincentivetoleavethecarathome,butstudentswho rely on a car will see their operating costs substantially increase. The counter argument would be that since the adoption of a transit pass program substitutes the construction of additional parking, which is an expensive undertaking, parking charges would have increasedanyways.   Students who continue to use the car still incur several indirect benefits: less traffic congestion, more parking availability (Brown et al., 1999) and cleaner air (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998). However, it is important to note that remaining car users represent potential switchers who have not found the benefits to taking transit to be sufficient for them to leave their cars at home. The case study on the Universit de Sherbrooke will exploremoreindepththecharacteristicsofthesestudentsandsubsequentlyoffersolutions toimprovetheUPassatUdeS. 
Given all indirect benefits enumerated above, active mode users are the least advantaged by a UPass program. This can be offset if transit authorities provide bicycle racks on their buses to increase multimodal opportunities. Nonetheless, benefits exist. Through focus group discussions led by Meyer and Beimborn (1998), students said that
 21

having easy access to transit holds the added benefit of acting as an insurance policy by providingthemwithavalidtransportationmodeasabackup. 
2.7.3. For the transit authority  Across all types of programs, whether university, employer or neighborhoodbased, a recurrent benefit to the transit agency is the guaranteed revenue. This allows the transit agency to diminish its reliance on fare box revenue (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998) and facilitates the agency's financial planning (Hester, 2004). For large programs like a universitybased UPass, the revenue stream is likely to be adaptive to service increases, thereforeitdoesnotonlyguaranteetoreplacethelostrevenuesfromthefareboxbutalso covers the costs of added service. In turn, this added service can attract other users and may increase revenues, as will be discussed further. A simplified transaction operation is anotherbenefitastherepresentativeofthegroup,inourcasetheuniversity,makesasingle transactionwiththetransitauthority.Thiscanreducelineupsatticketbooths,easeaccess to transit and reduce costs from multiple transaction operations. Also, in most cases, the students' university ID card becomes the transit pass. This enables the agency to save on printingcostsofticketsandpasses.Moreover,makingeverystudententerwithaprepaid pass will ease access to transit and can potentially reduce boarding times. Another advantage of universitybased programs comes from the fact that students  more often than other transit users  use transit more frequently outside peak hours (Meyer and Beimborn, 1998). This particularity brings down the operating cost of routes serving the universityasstudentsfillunusedcapacity.Thefollowingbenefitsrelatetomoreinternalor administrativeconcerns,andarehardertoquantify.
22 

 As the selling of a monthly transit pass ensures the agency with revenue for the
whole month, UPass revenues are perceived for even longer periods, usually for a whole semester. This large sum is gathered before the service has been provided, which can also contribute to simplify financial operations. Here, the payment scheme resembles that of a store offering its customers to take possession of a good right away while paying for it in several payments. In our case, roles are reversed and the transit agency holds the advantage: users pay the full price upfront while the service for which they have already paidforwillbeprovidedthroughoutthesemester. 
Last but not least, the following point describes possible outcomes from increased ridership. A study by Brown, Hess and Shoup (2001) surveyed UPass programs at 35 universitiesandrevealedthatincreasesinstudenttransitridershiprangedfrom71percent to 200 percent for the first year of the program and that growth continued at a rate between 2 percent to 10 percent per year the following years. Although the literature is unanimous on the fact that UPass programs do increase student ridership, the pricing schemeoftheUPassdoesnotenableittoclaimthatmoreridershipmeansmorerevenues. Once again, the pricing scheme between the university and the agency is meant to break even,notmakemorerevenuesonthebackofstudents.Forexample,Meyer'sstudy(1998), effectivelydescribesthecaseoftheMCTS,Milwaukee`stransitagency,thathadtoincrease serviceonroutesservingtheuniversity.SincethiswasduetotheimplementationoftheU Pass,andthestudentsanduniversitywouldbetheonesbenefitingfromtheaddedservice, itisnotasurprisethattheywouldcovertheadditionalcost.Infact,inorderfortheagency
 23

to break even, UPass fees had to be raised. This being said, ridership increases will not generate revenue benefits per se, but will generate external benefits through service improvements. Indeed, service improvements make for increased quality and quantity of transitbymakingbusesmorefrequent,byaddingmoreroutesorexpressservices,andby extending hours later at night and on weekends. Even more so, these improvements hold the potential to increase the number of riders who will pay the full fare and thus might increase revenues. Other advantages of increased transit ridership include increased bus efficiency, reduced operating cost per ride, and reduced dependence on government subsidies(Brownetal.,2001).Finally,participationinsuchaprogramconstitutesahighly valuedandhighlypositivepublicityforthetransitagency. 
2.7.4. For the community  Additionaltransitservicesmadetoaccommodateanincreaseinridershipstronglybenefits regular users who will have more frequent bus service. In addition, these added services can help attract new users outside of the university context who will switch to transit but paytheregularfareprice.Asidefromcostreduction,UPassmayhaveanimportantimpact ondailycommutingtimefornotonlyparticipantsintheprogrambutthewholecommunity asmorecarsaretakenoffthestreets,resultinginsignificantoveralltimesavings.Benefits inducedarethosecommonlyassociatedwithareductionoftrafficonanysetinfrastructure.

2.8. Disadvantages  
Despitethefactthatadvantagesarenumerous,therearealsosomedisadvantages. Afirstweaknesscomesthroughtheprocessofimplementationitself,sincenegotiationscan belongandlaboriousbeforeallpartiesagreeonthecostsoftheprogramandcontribution expectedfromeach. 
It is stated that the largest constraint for universities depends on whether they can find support from student associations while imposing tuition fees and often increasing parkingfeesaswell(Hester,2004).Naturally,effortswillbegreateriftheuniversityrelies entirely on student contribution to cover the costs. On the contrary, if the university subsidizes the entire cost of the program, efforts to convince members are no longer necessary, and the high cost the university must now ensure becomes the main disadvantage(Hester,2004). 
For the transit authority, benefits can greatly fluctuate. As mentioned previously, a determining factor is the amount of service present on the routes that will be served. Although ridership increases are associated with revenue increases, here, new riders use buses at a highly discounted rate that does not ensure added revenue. Rather, ridership increases may require additional buses that might represent a cost that will not be recovered(dependingontheuniversity/agencycontract)andreducetheagency'scostper rider efficiency on certain lines. The agency must also anticipate the need to deploy measurestopreventabusivepassuse,suchassharing.AsmentionedbyHester(2004),this
26 

requires preparation of a strategy and the improvement of administrative attention and personneltraining. 
For those students who continue to use the car or active modes such as biking or walking, disadvantages take the form of equity concerns, especially when the program is mandatory. On the other hand, optout programs require students to pay a higher price, thus reducing the attractiveness of the program and its benefits. The environmental justificationsshouldeasilyoutweighoppositionofnonusers.

2.9. What comes out of all this? 
To summarize, advantages considerably outweigh the disadvantages and success stories have been reported coming from various contexts. Brown, Hess & Shoup's 2001 study highlights the results of implementing Unlimited Access programs in 35 universities throughout the United States. Although these programs were offered in very different settings  from small towns to large cities and small (4,500) to large size (49,000) student bodiestheynotedthattransitridershipincreasesrangedfrom71percentto200percent during the first year. Undoubtedly, universities have proven to offer the ideal settings for suchprogramstobesuccessful.
 Other than the fact that universities constitute a large basin of population with a commondestination,twomajorcontributingelementsstoodoutoftheliterature.First,the governance is simple as it involves only the transit agency and theuniversityrather than having various entities to coordinate like in a community setting. Second, the university
 27

controls both its land use and parking availability, which simplifies the adoption of complementingincentiveanddisincentivemeasures(Senft,2005). 
2.10. Previous comparable research 
As shown in the previous sections, studies on the subject cover distribution of costs and appropriationofbenefitsamongstthedifferentplayers.Theyprovideusefulevaluationsof success rates of university pass programs. However, few studies have focused on market segmentation and none have been published using a quantitative approach aimed at improvinganexistingprogram,asitisthecaseinthisreport.Acloseexamplecomesfrom MeyerandBeimborn's study, where segmentation charts were used to betterunderstand transit market capture rates for University of WisconsinMilwaukee's students. Their evaluation was based on information such as: proximity to transit services, simple or complex trip patterns,class schedules, andfull or parttime employment. Results indicate thatthepersonmostlikelytousetransitlivesneartransit,hascomplextrippatternsandis aday/eveningstudent. 
3. RESEARCH DESIGN 
In this report, we seek to identify what factors have acted as incentives for Universit de Sherbrooke's students to use public transit instead of a private vehicle. A test using data obtained from the 2005 universitywide survey is performed using Random Forest (RF) classificationmethod.

 3.1.2. Problematic of the Universit de Sherbrooke   This section describes how the Universit de Sherbrooke was brought to consider the U Pass and how it implemented the program. Sherbrooke's university transit pass program pridesitselfonbeingthefirstUPassprogramintheprovinceofQuebecwhileofferingthe highesttransitdiscountforcitiesof150000inhabitantswithinCanada.  In 2003 the university's student federation (Fdration tudiante de l'Universit de Sherbrooke) produced a comprehensive report entitled "Le transport en commun   31

Sherbrooke" to further encourage students to use public transit, and to convince prospective students to choose the city of Sherbrooke for their studies. This document presented the current situation of public transit services in the city, as well as transport issuesfacedbystudentsandalistofimprovementstobemade.Theirmainconcernwasto supportthecreationofadiscountedtransitpassforallstudentswithoutagerestriction.In thesameyear,theirrequestwasgrantedandstudentscouldridetransitatanadvantageous rate no matter their age.

Meanwhile, UdeS was facing serious parking issues as the student body was increasing at a rate of about 4 percent each year while transit service was decreasing.  In 2003, demand for parking was such that cases of delinquent parking were common. According to Alain Webster, viceprincipal of the University's sustainable development office,driverswereseenparkingtheircarsonthelawnaroundbuildings,onsidewalks,and evenstaircases.Withthewaitinglistforparkingpermitsincreasing,aninvestmentneeded to be made for the construction of additional parking. Instead, officials decided to act differently, even though, contrary to other more centrally located universities, UdeS had land available, which meant a lesser cost to build surface parking if needed. However, the universitywasnotatitsfirstattempttoresolvetheparkingissueoncampus,andtoavoid
32 

facing the same problem in another five years they decided to approach the situation differently by changing their perception of the problem. In this sense, building additional parkingwascomparedto`buildingyourwayoutofcongestion'ortowhatLewisMumford oncesaid:"addinghighwaylanestodealwithtrafficcongestionislikelooseningyourbeltto cureobesity".Indeed,theproblemnolongerresidedinthelackofparkingspacesbutinthe factthatthereweretoomanydrivers.
 Revenues related to transport and transport infrastructures generally come from governmentalsubsidiesattheministryofeducation.Parkinginfrastructureisnoteligibleto these subsidies, leaving the university responsible to cover expenses regarding construction, maintenance and management of its parking. It was estimated in 2005 that theunitcostpersurfaceparkingspacewasof4000$and30000$forundergroundparking (Rajotte,2005).Inaddition,buildingparkingencouragescaruseandtakesupalotofspace, whichwouldhavecontradictedwithitsnewsustainableapproach.  UdeSexploredotheruniversitypoliciesregardingtransportationsuchas:increasing parking charges; banning students (or certain students such as undergraduates) from bringing cars to campus; adopting an active marketing strategy to promote existing transport alternatives or build additional infrastructure; and improving existing services. All of these alternatives were left out as they only seized one aspect of the problem: to discourage car use or to encourage the use of transit. None of these avenues had the integratedapproachtheuniversitysought.Moreover,theapproachitwaslookingforwould become the "fer de lance" of its sustainability program (called Plan vert). This program
 33

consisted in reducing its GHG emissions, increasing overall efforts towards recycling, fostering community involvement and ensuring a sustainable growth of its campus. As transportation underlies most of these goals, it became obvious they needed to directly tacklethetransitproblem.TheuniversitysettledontheUPassasithadprovenelsewhere toreachthegoalstheyhadsetthemselves. 
3.1.3. Presentation of the program:    Similarly to other reviewed programs, each studentenrolled at the university received a new student ID card that would serve as their transit pass, giving them access to an unlimitednumberofridesbybusintheterritorycoveredbySherbrooke'stransitauthority.
 WhentheUPassprogramwasintroducedin2004,theUniversityagreedtopay100 percent of the bill for a period of 5 years at a cost of 865 000$. Usually, since both the university and the students benefit from this measure, the cost is generally split between the two (Brown et al., 2001). UdeS justified its choice by the fact that it greatly simplified the implementation process (University law claims that any additional student fee higher than 15$ must be submitted to a referendum7). Moreover, promoting free and unlimited access to transit for all students helps to maximize the success rate of the UPass, and is equallyeffectiveasanaggressivepromotionalcampaigntoencouragetheuseofbuses. As it was mentioned previously in the literature review, UdeS paid the STS the equivalent amounttowhatthetransitauthorityearnedpriortotheprogram,fromstudentsridingthe bus. In addition, this amount was indexed each year to reflect the increases in labor costs  7Webster,Alain,PersonalCommunication,December8th2010.
34 

andgaspricesaswellascostsrelatedtoadjustingtheservicetomeetincreasingdemand. Similarly to most universities, UdeS partly subsidized its UPass through parking fare increases. The other part came from their budget in the hope they could later rely on federal and provincial subsidies as well as publicity or sponsorship revenues to assume these costs. The money never came, and because of financial difficulties UdeS had to cut partofthefunding.Also,sinceitcouldnotrelyentirelyonparkingfees,theyhadtorevise theirmodeofpayingthecostofunlimitedaccess,whichhadreached1.3millionby2009.
 "Abolishingtheprogramwasneveranoption"saidAlainWebster(VicePrincipalof Sustainable Development). Instead, the university reached out to students and engaged an opendebatetofindasolutiononhowtosplitthecosts.The1.3millionwouldnowbesplit equallyandadjusted,likemostotherprograms,basedonthenumberofstudentsregistered attheuniversity.  Since 2009, the transit authority along with the university negotiated the value for allstudentstohaveunlimitedaccesstotransitatacostof55.80$persemesterperfulltime student. The STS charges a smaller amount (39.76$) for parttime students as they use transit less often. These charges are now equally divided between the university and the students. As shown in Table 4, the later now have an outofpocket cost of only 27$ per semester. Students who previously paid the regular monthly transit pass at the rate of 62.50$forthe4monthsofasemester(4x62.50$=256$),theUPassrepresentsan89.5% discount.

Since the beginning of the program in 2004, the university subsidizes the UPass

through its parking fees. This aspect not only enables the university to find sufficient

Parking prices at UdeS have increased for students and employees. Student's contribution help pay for a part of the costs of providing unlimited transit access while employees  who have yet to gain access to the UPass  help finance the university's sustainabledevelopmentstrategiessuchascomposting,usingreusabledishes,etc.

3.1.4. Outcomes of the UPass  In the winter term of 2005, 5 months after the implementation of the program, the university conducted a universitywide survey in order to assess the impact on student mode choice. Data from the survey show a considerable change in student modal share sincetheadoptionoftheUPass8.  Bususeincreasedbyanimpressive31percentthe31%solutionofourtitlewhichmade the bus responsible for more than half (57 percent) of student's trips to UdeS. Most importantly, this variation of 120 percent means the car has been surpassed by public transportation as the dominant mode9. As shown in Table 6, most of the new transit users werepreviouscaruserswhoswitchedtotakingthebus.Otherstudentswhoswitchedwere mostlypedestriansbutalsocyclistsandtaxiusers.

For one academic year (28 weeks), the implementation of the UPass allowed to save 4 149 600 vehicle kilometers traveled to UdeS.

b.Impactonparking The reduction in car users by 39% allowed the university to cancel building additional parkingfacilityoncampusandcontributedtoreduceparkingpermitssoldin2005by977. This important reduction in demand allowed the university to close down a 1000 unit parkinglot,althoughthenumberofstudentsincreaseseachyear.Parkingcitationrevenues dropped consequently. This loss in revenue was mitigated by the savings evaluated at 85 000$inmaintenance(Rajotte,2005).Figure2showstheoldcentrallylocatedparkingthat was converted into a pedestrian oriented green space.

In all, combining economic, social and environmental goals, the UPass allowed a modal transfer from the car to a more respectful mean of transport, which led to physical andsocialimprovementsoftheuniversity'senvironment. 
In the region, the university's initiative and success story became an example for otherstostartasimilarprogram.Boththecity'scollegiallevelinstitutionandtheHospital Center adopted their own discounted pass programs. Also, in the province of Quebec, the UniversitLavalinthecityofQuebeciscurrentlyworkingonimplementingaprogramfor theirstudentswhiletheUniversitdeMontraljustannouncedthestartofitspilotproject for the fall of 2011. Undoubtedly, there is an interesting dynamic happening where transportationissuesarebeingaddresseddifferently.

3.2. Data source 
The data used in this paper originated from the survey conducted by the Universit de Sherbrooke in 2005. UdeS provided the data file as well as the questionnaire. The questionnaire was sent through the university's internal emailing system to a list of all students enrolled in the winter term of 2005 (about 25 000 students). Only students enrolled in the satellite campus of Longueuil, 150 kilometers from Sherbrooke, were excluded as their geographical location makes them ineligible to the UPass. In order to gatherinformationonthemodalshareandtravelinghabitsofstudentsbeforeandafterthe implementationoftheUPass,thesurveywassentattheendofthewinterterm,5months afterthestartoftheprogram.Thequestionnairecontainedatotalof39questionsandtook on average 15 minutes to complete depending on the respondent's profile. Students were asked to provide profile information (age, sex, student status, place of residence, etc.), current and pre UPass travel habits (mode, distance, commute time, etc.) as well as opinionsonSTSservicesandimprovementmeasuresregardingtravelingtoUdeSusingall transportation modes. Although the response rate was very satisfactory, participating respondents totaled only 2 percent of parttime students, who collectively represent 51.5 percent of the total student population. For this reason, this study focuses on fulltime students. With 2671 respondents the survey has a representative sample of fulltime

R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. ISBN 3900051070, URL http://www.Rproject.org/.) as the package randomForest (A. Liaw and M. Wiener (2002). Classification and Regression by randomForest. R News 2(3), 1822.).  A key advantage of RF for this given study is its capacityforrobustanalysisofdatasetscomposedunlikelyofdiscretevariables,withother cited advantage of   "(1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictorvariables"(Cutler,2007).RFusesdecisiontreesasapredictivemodeltoclassify in order of importance  the main variables that explain the dependent variable. The RF algorithm uses bootstrap aggregating (or bagging) to randomly select a set of predictor variables, which are then assigned a score based on the frequency of their presence in the model, increasing therobustness.  For our research, this method is particularly helpful at distinguishingwhichvariableisworthaddressingthroughourdescriptiveanalysis.TheRF method will enable this by classifying all 46 variables in order of their strength from the mostinfluentialtotheleastinfluentialatpredictingstudenttravelhabits.

different statistical method capable of running a similar analysis was chosen. Random Forests (RF) is a relatively new method in the field of statistical classification. It is more often used in machine learning and biology where it has proven to be a strong analytical tool.
 RF was applied to the two previously mentioned groups of variables: variables relatingtostudentprofilesandthoserelatingtostudentopinions.Analysisofthe"profile" group provides us with detailed information on two subgroups by identifying who are the remainingcardrivers(nonswitchers)andwhoarethenewtransitusers(switchers).More importantly,ithighlightsinorderofimportance,thedeterminingvariablesresponsiblefor encouraging students to switch modes.

Figure 5 confirms this hypothesisbyportrayingadistincttendencyfordistrictsfurtherawayfromtheuniversity tohavelessswitchers;amongstthem,RockForest(68%)andFleurimont(65%).Referring back to Figure 1 of the map of Sherbrooke, this tendency can be explained by both the distance and a lower availability of bus service to get to the university. All remaining districts are located closer to the university and benefit from higher bus frequency;
52 

accordingly, they all have a higher proportion of switchers. Residents from Sherbrooke West, Universit de Sherbroke district, and the Downtown district show the highest proportion of switchers. At the other end of the spectrum, the "other" category relates to districts that are far from the university and outside STS's service area, hence the 88 percentrateofnonswitchers.

Figure7Descriptivechartof"caraccess"variable
          
Accessibility to a car is the third most important variable. Whether students have access to their own car, their parent's or their partner's, the accessibility to a vehicle
 53

increases their probability of being nonswitchers. At the opposite, 90 percent of students who do not have access to a car responded very favorably to the UPass and switched to transit. Students who have access to a car but decided to switch nonetheless have a high chance of being previous passengers who now benefit from increased autonomy in their travel needs. This hypothesis was reinforced by an interesting underlying fact as we observed that passengers have a higher tendency to switch (71%) compared to drivers (47%).Accordingly,thecorrespondingvariable(BeforemodeorBMod)isrelativelyhighin thelistofpredictivevariables.Finally,itispossiblethatnonswitcherswhoansweredthey donothaveaccesstoacar(10%)arealsovehiclepassengers.Theydonothaveaccesstoa carasadriver,butthecarremainstheirprimarymodeoftransportation.

At the opposite of what we would expect, 47 percent of students living less than 500 meters away from the university still use their car. We must be cautious when interpreting the results, as two thirds of respondents live more than 5 kilometers away fromtheuniversity.Further,thegeneraltrendseemstoindicatethatstudentslivingcloser totheuniversitytendtoswitchmoreeasilytotransit.

     When asked: "What is the determining factor when choosing your place of residence?" with no surprise, the vast majority of respondents answered the "Price of housing" with a slightly larger number of nonswitchers. Respondents may be inclined to choose this answer as it does not relate to any proximity factor as opposed to the three remaininganswers.However,itisinterestingtonotethatnonswitchers(55%)valuetheir proximity to general services more than switchers (45%), whereas switchers value their proximitytotransit(96%)andtotheirstudyarea(52%). 
56 

The RF analysis shows that the following variables have a strong predictive value (Figure 3), however, the "p value from permutations" (Figure 4) shows no statistical significance for these variables. Their effect in predicting a student's tendency to switch is unimportant and consequently must be excluded when estimating potential switchers. Nonetheless, for the task at hand, these variables contain interesting information to characterizetheprofileofswitchersandnonswitchersatUdeS. 
Figure10Descriptivechartof"studentlevel"variable
            
 
 57

Another interesting predictive variable is the level of studies. Figure 10 shows an increase in the number of nonswitchers as students get further in their level of studies. Nonetheless, undergraduate students in first and second year are more likely to be attracted by the UPass program and switch to transit (respectively 60% and 55% switchers). The number of nonswitchers becomes dominant at the third year (52%) and this number further increases in the fourth year (62%). A drop occurs in the categories of graduate and doctoral students but they remain mostly car users (respectively 52% and 56%). Finally, postdoctoral students show a very high propensity to remain car users, as 80%ofthemdidnotswitch.Asstudentsinhigherlevelsofeducationtendtobeolder,this variableiscorrelatedwithage,explainingwhytheobservationsaresimilar.Therefore,we canalsoaffirmthatstudentlevelscorroboratewiththelikelihoodofhavingchildrenanda certaindecreaseinabilitytochangetravelhabits.           
58 

Figure11Descriptivechartof"age"variable
            
 It is interesting to note the bar chart shows a gradual increase in nonswitchers as the age of students increase. In summary, the majority of students 28 and younger  with the exception of 2324 year olds  are more inclined to switch, whereas the majority of students 29 and older tend to continue to use the car. A possible explanation lies in car ownership, which rises with the increase of age of students. The car represents a travel optiontheyhavealreadypaidfor,whichincreasesthelikelihoodofthemusingit.Another possible explanation, as mentioned previously, is that older students have a higher probabilityofbeingparents,anditisknownthathouseholdswithchildrentendtouseacar moreoften.
 59

Figure12Descriptivechartof"work"variable
            
The "work" variable shows the majority of workers generally switch and non workers tend to remain car users. A closer look at Figure 12 shows a differential effect between parttime and fulltime workers. Parttime workers are more attracted by the U Passmeasure,as57percenthaveswitchedtotransitcomparedto42percentforfulltime workers. A more indepth analysis revealed that parttime workers are usually fulltime students who prioritize their studies while the job provides revenues for daily expenses. The56$permonthdiscountofferedbytheUPasshasagreatvaluetothemasitrepresents the equivalent of 6 work hours at the current minimum wage. By contrast, fulltime workers tend to be parttime students (59%). Similarly to the two previous variables, the
60 

age of fulltime workers can be a determining factor, decreasing their chances of taking transit. 
The RF analysis has provided valuable information by classifying opinion variables in order of their predictive power to switch or not to public transit. Out of the 16 opinion variables, we were able to concentrate our analysis on the 5 most important variables (faculty, district, access to car, distance and determining factor when choosing residence) andthe3thatprovidedbothasignificantpredictivevalueandhighanalyticalopportunities (student level, age and work). The remaining 8 variables highlighted by the RF model are weaker predictive variables meaning their effect over switching is smaller. Nevertheless, theycanprovideUdeSofficialswithmoredetailsonwhotheswitchersandnonswitchers areandarethereforepresentedintheAppendix.

For the university, this figure demonstrates that parking was still an issue in 2005,
one term after the UPass was implemented. Moreover, both switchers and nonswitchers
list parking as an issue to resolve with priority or high priority (respectively 63% and
81%). It is interesting to see that new transit users are willing to second a measure that
would go against their principals expressed earlier by easing car use on campus.

In addition, having in hand the dominant traits of remaining potential switchers, i.e. studentswhomostlykeptcomingbycar,theuniversitycanmoreefficientlyfocusitsefforts on them. Indeed, UdeS can still hope to attract new users and improve its success. As we haveseen,theprogramhasattractedamaximumofstudentssensitivetoadecreaseinthe costofpublictransit.With90percentofthecostoftheUPasssubsidizedbytheuniversity, reluctantstudentsarepreoccupiedbyexternalcostssuchaseaseofuse,comfortandtime of travel.

Keepingthisinmind,wehaveproducedalistofpriorityinterventionsbasedontheoutput oftheRFmodel: 
 Organize a promotional campaign aimed at reluctant faculties: medicine, health sciences and administration, but also towards students who are in their third and fourth year of undergraduate studies or are graduate, doctoral or postdoctoral students, and to those 29 years of age or older.

transportation options may lead to more permanent changes if the service is adequate(ToorandHavlick,2004);   ForthosewholiverelativelyfarfromUdeS,theuniversityshouldconsidersending personalized public transit itineraries (using postal codes) through the internal e mailingsystem;  Finally, The discounted transit fare allowed increasing the gap between the perceived costofusingacarandtheactualcostoftakingtransit.Forthosewhocontinuetouseacar, this gap must be enlarged for them to start considering other options. Based on this, restrictions on student parking should not be overlooked even if instituting them can be controversial.   Examplesfromotheruniversitiesinclude:raisingparkingpermitprices,introducing an adaptive parking fare increase based on distance traveled and/or not issuing parking permits to students who live relatively close to the campus, restricting access to campus to firstyear and secondyear students, or launch a system of variablepermitcostsbasedonthenumberofdaysastudentparksoncampus;  Asforphysicalinterventions,   UdeS should prioritize walking, cycling and transit modes on its campus as both switchersandnonswitcherssupportthismeasure;

  Last but not least, allpossible serviceincreases regarding public transit and active transport should be addressed, whether they be in the form of extended service hours, more buses, a dedicated shuttle service between campuses, more bicycle lanesorpedestrianpaths.

5.1. Limitations  
Itisimportanttonotethatlimitationsofthisstudyareinherenttothecontextinwhichthe surveywasconducted.Factorslikelanduse,density,population,seasonality,locationofthe campus in regards to the cityare all subject to changefrom one context toanother. Thus affectingparticipationratesandprofileofstudentsadheringtoaUPassprogram. 
Another limitation comes from the sample itself. Although it is large, it has left out part time students who represent 51.5 percent of enrolled students for the 20042005 academicyearwhileonly2percentweresurveyed.Forthisreasontheresultsobtainedin thisstudyconcernfulltimestudentsonly.Concerningrecommendationsputtofront;since thedatawascollectedin2005,certainredundanciesmayshowbetweenwhatisproposed and what has already been applied in terms of transportation investments and service improvementsatUdeSinrecentyears. 
 75

Finally, it is uncommon for universities to subsidize entirely a UPass program as it wasthecaseforUdeSin2004.Consequently,theresultsobtainedfromthelaunchoftheir UPass could be slightly more positive than nonsubsidized or even partly subsidized programs. 
6. CONCLUSION 
In this work, it has been established that UPass brings undeniable benefits to all parties involved.Withthemethodologyused,RandomForestsclassificationmethod,wewereable to identify switchers from nonswitchers according to a number of criteria.We were also able to clearly identify the particular needs of each subgroup that has enticed or deterred them to switch. From my review of the literature, I believe that this methodology, commonlyusedinthefieldofbiologyandmachinelearning,isapowerfultoolthatcouldbe appliedtootherstudiesinthefieldofurbantransportation.Indeed,theRFmodelishighly successful at classifying users as switchers or nonswitchers (classification success rate), offeringstrongpredictivepowerofstudenttravelhabits.Wecanthusstipulatethatsimilar surveys,oreventhinnedoutsurveysincludingonlythemostrelevantquestionshighlighted here, combined to an analysis through RF may help predict the success rate of a UPass in differentcontexts.Thisinformationwouldbeavaluableassetfortheinitialdesignphaseof the program and for conceiving marketing strategies towards reluctant switchers. Also, a more accurate evaluation of demand will help transit authorities determine the applicable discountandpossibleserviceadjustments. 
76 

We also demonstrate that what could have been considered at first glance homogeneous populations of potential transit users, is in fact constituted of various sub groupswithspecificneedsthatrequiredistinctsolutions.Amongstthestudentpopulation of UdeS, it clearly appears that those students whose classes are scattered in different locations(thoseregisteredinmedicineandhealthsciencesfaculties)findtheuseoftransit inefficient for their needs. This is an organizational barrier that could be solved although may prove to be costly. On the other hand we have those students registered in business who apparently still believe that a car is an indispensable appendix to their personality. This can only be addressed through a change in culture. It will require appropriate leadership, positive reinforcement, time and probably some fairly stiff rates that will encourage them to leave their cars at home. Finally, for those who require a private car becausetheyliveoutsidethetransitsystem'sservicearea,thisisaproblemthatshouldbe treated by those considering the incident of urban sprawl, although, a satellite parking couldprovidethenecessaryincentiveforsomestudents.
 From the results obtained, there is no doubt that the experiment at UdeS will be profitably extended to other categories (employee and faculty). Our case points to the fact thatthethresholdforwhichadiscountedtransitpassisbeneficialisprobablysmallerthan expected regarding the size of the community served, density of the population, centrality ofitslocationandsizeofthetransitnetwork.Thishelpshighlighttheuntappedpotentialof transferringsuchprogramstoavarietyofcontexts.
